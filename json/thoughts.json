I’m unable to hold conversations with people online for more than a few messages because I get bored and averse to talking with them\n- And the strangest thing is this feeling makes me miss [1ST GIRLFRIEND] again\n- Which isn’t that hard to figure out why but still WHAT THE FUCK?\n- When I was with her, a) I had a really strong interpersonal relationship with her online and b) I was still by myself physically.\n- B) meant that I was still somehow magically by myself even when I was talking with her, which is part of why I have trouble putting myself in social situations now, because they are all in person and my mind wants me to be ALONE during social situations, somehow, some way\n- And A) means that I can’t even have online relationships now which WOULD fulfill the “requirements” of B) because I go “well this online relationship doesn’t give me the same feelings as [1st girlfriend] did so it’s not worth it”\n- I got spoiled with a really good online relationship really early and now not only do I miss it but it’s my baseline so any other online relationship PALES in comparison"

I told myself that nothing I was processing was worthy or able to be written down; that I’d remember it; that it wasn’t doing that much more me anyway and was ultimately a fruitless endeavor.\n- Luckily in the past few days I have started to seriously doubt this, as I have written more and recorded more of my own feelings down, albeit all digitally\n- And I really realized how false those beliefs were today when I reread some of what I had written months ago. Being able to remember how I felt in a time that I had already all but forgotten about was almost surreal, and very intimate. It’s amazing that writing can bring me back to that same moment months or even years later - and it was as so obvious how the process of writing helped me understand myself and the world more, both then when I wrote it and again, in a different way, now when I read it.\n- I empathize with my past self, I see thought patterns I still carry today and some that I have dropped. I read realizations I had and realize them all over again because I had forgotten them. I see connections I made or points brought up that I no longer agree with and see that I have grown. I am not that person anymore, as crucial as they were to who I am now.\n- Hello to myself, I love you."

    "text": "- The one piece I’ve always been missing, the one thing I’ve never been able to figure out, is this: why act?\n- I *know* of many many reasons. To live is to act. Life is of no consequence, so live ecstatically in the moment and do what your nature commands you to. Doing nothing is the same as doing something given the arbitrariness of it all, so might as well do something\n- But I’ve never gotten a “driving force” to act, the strongest I’ve ever gotten is a “might as well bc it doesn’t matter” which to me is passive not active. I can just as easily say “might as well not because it doesn’t matter”.\n- This comes I think from a deep but incomplete dive into Zen and buddhist practices and beliefs - enough to know the oneness of it all and understand why this is all NOT that serious, but not enough to know why we should treat it as serious again after all is said and done\n- Of course “the answer” is to take things as seriously as they are to you and look honestly and purely at what things are\n- Carrying water: marvelous action. Chooping wood: wondrous movement. Or whatever it is.\n- The GOOD news is that I have a strong appreciation for the mundane world around me. I have that in abundance - I always have, and this is one of my strongest traits, noticeable both to me and those around me\n- But this appreciation doesn’t make me want to charge up and take action in the world - on the contrary, it makes me want to sit down and observe things as they are forever, perfect in their undisturbed nature, without touching them, and when something bad happens I just say “it is what it is” rather than try and fix it\n- Good in some cases but bad in others - i find it hard to push myself to achieve and change my surroundings! I settle easily!\n- It seems that in my observing and appreciation of the world as it operates, I am missing some link to let me believe that I am part of the world too and that my own operation should be just as sacred to me"

    "text": "- A bit more on the previous entry. I have been being more “mothering” to myself recently, emotionally. I have been allowing myself to cry, and rather than either trying to “pull myself together” or even comforting myself, I simply allow myself to cry. I don’t try to mull over what thought brought on the crying, especially since the thought is usually only tangentially related. Crying from the emotion of crying is pure and beautiful, regardless of how it feels.\n- This is of course a slight romanticization of the act of crying and the feeling of depression. But I don’t think this is making me stay in depression - rather, I think I am going to move out of this bout of depression faster than I would have otherwise.\n- To reach a state of depression that feels “good” is an odd thing, and is only a sign that you won’t stay there forever. It feeling good is an inspiration, a creative drive, and clear breath. Depression is not often fueled by these things.\n- It is okay for me to feel beautiful and sad, especially after the dark moment I was just in recently. I still feel beautiful and sad - although I know this bout of depression won’t be long, neither will it be short. My home experience now is dimly lit and vaguely cyan purple and watery.\n- I say it is my “home” experience now not literally, in that my physical house home feels like this, and not in terms of my overall experience feeling like this either. I do not always feel this way even while I’m in this period, but it is what my mind returns to and has been anchoring itself in.\n- I still have moments of joy and stupidness and humor and sociality. It is just as though they are pasted onto this poorly lit dripping periwinkle background.\n- And in line with that, I am beginning to wholly except these deviations. I think I have historically had a problem with realizing the temporality of emotions, both in their shortness and longness.\n- As in, I forget that if I am feeling depressed, it will not last forever - at least, I forget this emotionally even if not logically. I historically have had trouble removing myself from these depressive feelings because I feel as if the feelings are simply still there - by assuming they will persevere and last even though social situations and humor, by this self fulfilling prophecy they do last because I make them, and I refuse to move on\n- And, quite opposite but still related, I forget that if I leave this depressive state and experience humor and joy, I will nevertheless return back to it once the overcurrent as passed. And this temporary deviation from it is not disingenuous or disrespectful to this feeling or my appreciation of it; I am allowed to part without feeling loss for what I no longer have, and I am allowed to return to it without feeling the guilt of a cheating lover returning to their original partner at night.\n- I do not owe these feelings singularity in my experience of them; they simply come and go. It does not make my experience of them while I am in them any more or less real, and does not make any deviations from them more or less real.\n- In any news, to speak again on my original topic, I have been comforting and nurturing to myself emotionally over the past few days, to soothe myself for the dark turn my thoughts took. I have not done this before, not like this, and it feels nice. I don’t need to come up with a solution to the worries that held my core in ice, I am allowed to simply cry about them and that is all."

Is that who we are as a species? Little creatures meant to hate themselves and then die?\n- It’s because we want things and we put expectations on things\n- This leads to suffering because the world is not ideal and what we want will not happen no matter what it is that we want\n- But why do we hate ourselves?\n- Because we view it as our fault of course\n- Not only do we feel the weight of our ego being crushed and ripped under the passage of time, but we also tell ourselves it’s our fault and that we could have done something more.\n- As long as there is uncertainty we will think we could have simply done something more, and it’s second nature to blame ourselves for not finding that thing\n- We are the only person we know intimately, and life to each one of us is nothing but pure unadulterated us. We are the only constant and the only thing we cannot get away from, and so we must be the cause of everything.\n- It’s not even that wrong of an idea. To my, my life is entirely me.

I believe that a) the continued life is worth the lost one because they are identical, and b) since I’m dying, it’s not like I’ll be sad about it or anything - whether I die right now or in 50 years, it’s the exact same after death\n- And yet, I’m scared to die of natural causes\n- The only real difference between these two scenarios is that in one of them some copy of me continues living and in the other one “it’s over”\n- And I don’t think the change comes from some belief that in the teleportation scenario I would actually “still continue on” because of the copy of me - I fully accept that as far as THIS me is concerned, I die when I teleport and that’s the end of it\n- Which is strange, because in that case I’m more okay with death in the teleportation scenario because *some life* continues on, in a sense continuing what I started knowingly, even though I am dead\n- That’s really the main distinction I think. If I die naturally, there is no continuation of my work or ideas. They all die with me, they’re over, everyone else’s turn.\n- In the teleportation scenario, there is some continuity in the fact that my ideas will definitively be continued to be worked on and developed with the proper respect (that is, the exact amount of respect that I give them)\n- Isn’t this really just because I know myself and have an attachment to my own ideas? Because everyone else has their own ideas that they want continued, just as real as mine, and if I die of natural causes their ideas WILL continue to live on.\n- In short, I’m scared of death because I view my own ideas and my own self as more important than the world around me and the ideas of those around me - I view them as more precious in some sense\n- But I’ll never ever ever ever ever actually be able to continue my ideas. Even in the teleportation scenario, those aren’t my ideas actually being continued - even if the person who comes out the other side is an exact copy, they start changing and being different from me the instant they start living\n- “My” ideas are only “my” ideas insofar as I view myself as a continuous thing. But *I* will not doing what the *copy* will do. Even if I “would have” done everything with my ideas that the copy would, I won’t, because I die. It’s the copy who continues on with my ideas and begin to shape them and change them and grow them how the copy wants to.\n- There is no possible way for my ideas to continue on as they are to me because the ideas don’t continue, and don’t have a fixed state. They change inside of my day to day, second to second, and are only “mine” insofar as time is frozen in place\n- In which case, the fact that my ideas change and become not mine isn’t even really tied to whether they belong to me or the copy or are being acted upon by me or the copy - they’re simply bound by the time period you look at them in.\n- My ideas will never live past me because there are no ideas to live. I am just as alone and “my ideas” are just as cut off in the teleportation scenario as in the natural death scenario.\n- I’m glad that this means that I’m more accepting of natural death rather than more afraid of teleportation death."

It’s a day where you’re really focused, you have a lot of time to work on it and figure things out, you have nothing distracting you, you are generating a lot of ideas, etc. So, taking advantage of this “perfect storm,” you begin.

Because of this, you will NEVER finish ANYTHING because you will NEVER have a “perfect *year*” in which to carry something to completion\n- The only reason you attribute it to the beginning is because you never GET to the middle or end of anything because perfect beginnings don’t exist in the first place!!\n- This gets back to the first reason I stated here, but that was what I had talked on previously so I’ll leave it at that rn"

When “becoming dopamine fried” I spend most of my time with 5 different things to consume up. I open two or three youtube videos at a time, have a game I can queue into and play quickly, etc. I spend my time watching one thing, pausing it a minute in to watch a different thing, then watching the original thing, playing matches for 30 minutes, then watching a third thing, then scrolling, then back to the first, ad nauseum.\n- And then I wonder why I find it hard to put prolonged effort into any sort of creative task.\n- My mind has gotten used to quick consumptive switching and action and lack of boredom. The second I try to “work on anything” suddenly a) the constant switching excitement stops and b) I’m expected to produce something\n- I spend a lot of time consuming, and the vast majority of the time that you’re consuming your brain is turned off and you’re not really a person.

It is truly by the human dsesire to grasp that we only infuriate ourselves by how hard it is to grasp - impossible, even, for that which is attempted to be grasped always changes fropm the original thing we tried to grasp. The child’s mind, infatuated with curiosity of the unknowable, does not linger and try to make the world stand still. it moves at the same pace as the world, instead of trying to make the world move at the same pace as it\n- It is only through our recognition of patterns that we begin to believe there is some underlying order to the world - that things can be defines, sectioned off, categorized, understood. The child has not seen these such patterns yet, and so experiences everything for the first time without attempting to subjugate it under the control of their own mind. The adult, upon getting a new experience, related it to similar experiences in the past, lumps it with them into one symbol standing for ta fixed idea of the amalgamation of all these individual isolated experiences, and then gets frustrated than none of these said isolated experiences is fixed and stationary and understandable like the symbol meant to contain them.\n- It is by familiarity and comparisons of similarity that the frustrate ourselves - it is by attachment to experiences of the past that we “ruin” experiences of the present.

The environment will change soon, so may as well just wait for that to happen to start something, end something, change something.\n- In the forest, there is absolutely no concept of schedule or events. Everything lives together, synchronously, at exactly the pace that they will. There is no rushing or dragging, for there is no concept of a thing to rush or drag, or a “correct” amount of time for a thing to be done in. Things simply happen - or, in a special sense of this case, things don’t happen. It is continuous and everchanging. The changes don’t follow any scale of time; the scale of time follows the things that change.\n- In this environment, when something is desired to be done, there is never any reason to wait. There are no boundaries anywhere; not in space, or in time. If both space and time are open fields, what could possibly be the point of waiting? What would you wait for? The forest will be the exact same in an hour to the exact degree that it will be completely different in an hour. There is no division of day and night; the trees stay standing and waiting as it turns dark, and as the sun’s rays hit them again. To them, the concept of “waiting” for something is foolish and unreasonable.\n- The world, as a general thing, moves at this same pace. Time simply continues; things and events keep changing at a constant pace. Why would you wait to start something, or work on something, when you are alive right now and the next hour will simply be a progression of time, same as this one?\n- We convince ourselves, through the accumulation of scheduled events and clocks, that there are temporal divisions in life. That life changes only at those intervals we arbitrarily decide, and that it remains constant in the interims. It is this disease of convenience, meant to help us organize what we do and expidite the process, that causes us to falter and slow our own production and desires. We start to live not by our experience of life, that everychanging and constant flow of minute progression, but by the experience of time blocked events. We do it “then”, we do it “in the future”, forgetting that the future will never come, and we are eternally living right now.\n- In the forest, you do it now. In life, you do it now.\n- Corrolary to this; in the forest, nothing happens for the sake of it happening.\n- The inverse of the message above, but for the same reason. If a tree wants to do something, it will do it right then, for it has no reason to wait and has no attachment to any moment of time, nor any attachment to any state anything is in.\n- For the same reason, if a tree has no reason to do something, it won’t do it. There is no reason to force an action simply to fill a void; if action and lack of action have the exact same meaning, why would lack of action ever be prioritized over action (why would the tree wait to do something) and why would action ever be prioritized over lack of action (why would the tree do something it has no reason to do?)"

The statement holds true for them; the forest can only give off what was once accepted into it. That is, anything that enters the forest leaves sopme sort of essence there, some sort of mark there. We can think of this as the forest “experiencing” whatever went into it. Those very marks can be experienced externally as thing output by the forest. In that sense, the forst, just like you, is simply a produce of all the experiences that it has had, and it can only output the marks of those experiences.\n- Consider yourself in those woods. You leave a mark in those woods yourself. The forest experiences you just as you experience the forest, and the marks you leave in the forest, the essence you left behind, may stay long after you’re gone and be experienced by something else.\n- In that sense, you are simply an input to, or an experience of, the forest.

I certainly made some progress through my own efforts, but what I really gained was simply a necessary time of frustration & uselessness that only benefits me now, looking back.\n- Previous to the aforementioned time, if we regard my mind as a tree, there were gnarled, twisted, rotting branches on my mind. That was all I had ever known. Any previous growth, anything added to my mind was perverted. And during that middle/end time of college, I suddenly learned a new feeling; healthy progress. This was attained by figuring out how to - and indeed, realizing I even could - cut off the gnarled branches. I cleansed the tree, opened up the space above the trunk from suffocating knots, invited sunlight in. It was my first breath of fresh air in a long, long, long time & I was ready to grow. \n- But, going into [late 2023/early 2024], I did not grow. I had learned that the only sizeable progress I had made was by pruning my tree & cutting branches, & so that’s what I tried to continue to do. At a time when I should have been, if anything, relaxing back from my tree to let it grow naturally as it would, finally unburdened from it’s infernal knot, I instead redoubled my efforts. I searched for more branches to remove, & when I found none I searched for twigs, and when I found none I started up a chainsaw to start cutting slices off the top of the trunk. I incessantly over-pruned & over-polished my tree, & convinced of the rightness of what I was doing, stood proud of my bare wooden spike & scoffed at everyone else upon seeing the existence of any branches upon their trunks, not realizing branches could be good.\n- I did not understand all this at the time, but never the less felt it. I spent a summer before this fitfully growing branches, but I was overbearing & cut them too. At this point I grew frustrated from the lack of branches without knowing it was the lack of branches I was frustrated with. I grew hopeless & despondent, & was reminded of & felt that all the the gnarled\n- branches I that once pruned were back, not realizing that no growth was happening not because knobby twisting vines were parasitically obscuring space as they once did, but because of my heavy hand & saw.\n- Growing sad, I put down the saw & sat, defeated, with my back to the tree, & only just now have I looked back & saw small branches starting to bud that I understand how trees grow."

But a child is happy to give an answer, they will smile gleefully, teeth apart while shaking their heads & giggling out a \"no\" because they see no opportunity closed, they are simply saying what they found out. But this is quickly undone through the learning of norms; a child sees “no’s” being accompanied by frowns, crestfallen faces, & learns to mimic this until they too feel despondent in face of a “no”, pursing their lips & shaking their heads quietly.\n- The learning of \"the world\" is no more than an accumulation of mastery over norms. This is at first fun, thrilling - learning is most fun thing a child can do, & they don't discriminate on subject. Every pattern memorized is exciting & prideful & pushes them forward.\n- We soon run out of norms to learn. We have been taught all we will be taught, & seen all the norms we will have seen. Here apathy sets in - there is nothing more to learn. We know it all. We become complacent that the world is no longer a wild place, & that we know how it works. However, if we were taught more, the pool of norms got bigger, we would keep drinking.\n- We are taught no more because people haven't \"figured out\" anything more. We hit the pressure change in the atmosphere that gasses don't rise above - nobody is taught anything because nobody knows any more to teach us, but we figure there is simply nothing else to learn. School, our entire formative years, teach us we only lean when taught. We are not taught how to lean without being taught.\n- But we are not mere gas particles; we have propulsion. We have curiosity.

    "text": "- 7/6/24\n- Yes, scale does matter in art. The size of something influences how you perceive it, and art is about perception. Simple as that. With smaller to \"medium size\" art pieces, you are allowed & encouraged to focus on small sections, & how they fit together. You are not only able to examine detail, but also the makeup of that detail; not just the stone decoration, but the texture a coloring of the stone. Large pieces of art, extremely large, don't allow this. Your smallness next to them becomes a large enough part of the experience as to occlude the ability to look closer. It becomes difficult to set your scale of attention to any smaller portion. \n- With a middling sized art piece, scaling down focus often creates an entirely separate art piece to acknowledge. The same is true of large art pieces, of course, but in a different way. Taking a section doesn't help you break apart & understand the larger picture anymore; the significance of these slices becomes the very fact that they are slices. The fact that you are missing the entire thing. It takes the importance off of the human being, off \"us\" & thus onto the not us. That shift in itself carries unspeakable weight.\n- There was no appreciation for the nooks & forgotten coves of the colosseum. The very size & direction of the architecture matters. It doesn't need to force your attention where go; your attention goes of it's own accord. No single piece wants to be seen; the group is the importance of it all.

To make a \"human\" art piece is synonymous to making a \"sad\" art piece. And I finally connected why - its as simple as sorrow being a loosely taboo subject. It is always pushed to be happy, to be okay, & sadness is usually only talked about in the context of “fixing it”. Support for depression, tools to manage, prescriptions to feel better, activities to \"try\", etc. Sadness, in public, is very much a thing to avoid & help others avoid. \n- And yet, obviously, everyone feels sadness & loneliness. So talking about it for the sake of talking about it and embracing it feels taboo, honest, personal, & intimate.\n- When else can you be sad & be okay with it than when you are, in essence, extolling the \"virtues\" of sadness? Going against common sentiment, feeling sad to feel sad. It feels defiant and honest & unique to each individual, which is what draws the eye of so many artists trying to be \"real\", even though doing so is just as surface level as trying to avoid sadness.\n- Right now, though, the point I want to talk about is not the \"right way\" to talk about sadness or how to do it justice in out without simply using its existence as the meaning & the justification for it. Rather, what strikes me is that the pull to sadness as the \"taboo, honest\" human experience is to forget that happiness is just as honest & human. Forget how often anything is talked about, joy is incredibly intimate as well - real, unfiltered, unashamed joy. So, too, is genuine confusion an honest human experience. And mild irritation, & concentration, etc. To focus on the \"underrepresented\" or \"misrepresented” aspects of humanity is to shun & belittle so many real aspects of humanity."

I find something I want to engage in, but instead of just engaging in it, I usually add it to some sort of list or bookmark it & \"come back to it later\" once I've made a list of many things to do, which sounds fine, except since I've prioritized making lists of engagements rather than actually engaging, I usually go out to find more things to add to the list rather than start actually going through the list. Eventually, I get bored of the entire topic of the list because I feel like I've already reached the point of \"doing the same things over & over\" when really I haven't even started engaging in the content of the list!\n- Essentially, I have a problem with curating lists of engagements without actually engaging in anything on the list, until I grow bored of the list \"and everything on it\" without ever having done a single thing on it. Start doing shit!\n- This comes from an issue of love of organizing and lack of foresight. I have a love for amassing easily transferable & curated lists of things to do, so that one day, I can \"go through the list” & do everything on it & I will have such an amazing time! However, in this, I completely fail to see that this guarantees I will never actually do the activities on the list. I can't do anything the future, I can only do things now, but if I always tell myself that now I'll work on the list so that in the future I can do the things on the list, I will only ever make the list/organize & never engage!\n- Things don't have to be perfectly organized for me to start; it's a deluded false fantasy, that if I just have the right starting pant, the rest will go well. This however, fails to acknowledge that a) just as things can go right from a bad start, so too can they go wrong from a good start, & b) a perfect advance start only exists if you know how the entire rest of the engagement will go, but since experience is grown & not constructed, you will never know how it will turn out, & therefore will never even know what a \"perfect start\" is!\n- It's a self frustration of wanting everything \"lined up\" so nothing goes wrong, but since nothing can be guaranteed to go right & knowing how things “should be lined up\" is not just impossible but is actually a nonsensical circular chase to find the start of the sky, I will never feel satisfied with the prep I've done & will never \"feel ready\" to start, so I doom myself to putter in circles in the preparatory phase forever. To start something is for it to go wrong.\n- It's a strange paradoxical fear, to feel like you are doing more by preparing, & doing less by following through. By engaging in something, you lock out ability to do other things. It feels minimizing, restrictive, to only do one thing. You are relegated to growing one branch. By staying in the planning stage & never engaging, all branches are possible. By starting something, you look at all other possible branches disappearing as you choose one to follow & feel like you confined yourself, not realizing that to not do anything is a branch of its own."

This arises at the intersection of \"letting the mind heal like a scab, it will fix itself\" & \"where do desires fit in\" & \"first (original) mind vs second (analytical) mind”.\n- It's useful, both in \"figuring things out\" & in creation, to let mind do what it will. This comes at a great frustration to the analytical mind, who so wants to take over & do the thinking or planning “correctly” and gets angry when the first mind doesn't solve the problem it wants to be solved.\n- That's the exact & only pitfall to be avoided - the original mind knows what it's doing, on a level of intuition that can never be reasoned out. Planning & constructing isn't artificial at all - the original mind excels at this! The issue is that we so often delegate those tasks to the analytical mind. The original mind will find connections that illuminate things for us that we never knew there was need for a path for, but we rebel because it doesn't \"seem right\" or we think we \"should\" do something else. This is all coping & frustration with the fact that our idealized supposition for how a process will/should go, especially in matters of thought, is so rarely the actual path taken - a path known only to our original mind."

    "text": "- 3/6/24\n- I find it hard to care about specific scenarios since I know they are just \"another experience\" & my mind naturally defers to the throughline of experiences rather than each experience itself.\n- By this I mean, take the concept of following something to its root. I feel that regardless of what the starting point is, you can choose anything; the ultimate root of it will be that it's just another experience & you should accept it for what it is. This makes it hard to put effort into expressing anything that isn't that because if I choose anything to express, I either do the work of processing it more & end up with that same root, or I don't put in the work but then I have a half finished idea that still has “problems left to solve\".\n- One consideration of this is that something causing that problem (me not \"caring\") is that I view the thing I'm expressing as a work in progress to be solved rather than an endpoint in itself. Of course it seems nonsensical to make a finished product conveying a WIP idea; I have to remind myself that sometimes the goal is simply to express an emotion without resolving it, & therefore I can think about it as it's own \"finished idea\". After all, I don't think every experience & emotion in real life simply exists as a WIP precursor to the next experience; each one simply exists in full inalienable self worth by itself & the idea of expressing one of those experiences as truly & wholly as possible, of invoking it in the audience, is perfectly fine.\n- As I write this, though, I wonder what the point of doing that is. What is the line between evoking an experience in the audience simply for the sake of evoking an experience vs evoking an experience in the audience for the sake of leaving some message or take away? The latter becomes redundant as soon as it is experienced once, & by trying to leave a message it really just leaves a WIP idea that begets the one common root, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place. The former, therefore, seems more pure & true, but if all it does is invoke an experience & then end & let the reader move on to the next experience in their own life, what is the point of constructing it in the first place? Since all experiences are equal, one constructed & presented is no more worthy than one natural & accidental, & so the audience would be just as well off sitting & watching the wind move the trees!\n- Even as I write that I of course realize the flaw in the framework; it's predicated on the assumption that created works of art need to have a point. It is enough for an experience to exist; since we are free to choose our experiences, we are also free to present experiences to others, & so there is nothing wrong with making a work of art that simply gives an experience.\n- The conflict here is therefore between me accepting that I can simply give an experience, & me trying to choose said experience based on what I \"want\" to give others. The want comes from which experiences I think are most important for others to have, but the importance comes from the experiences having a point or message, and I just established the loop that gets us into!\n- I would, then, say that I should choose experiences based on what moves me the most, but the things that move me the most speak to the arbitrary & cosmically comedic & tranquil nature of existence, or as stated before, the root of experiences. Not only is that a very large scope idea I don't have the skill to make art about yet, it is also just one experience, & I can't be a creator who makes a single artwork & that's it. \n- I think I therefore just have to accept that whenever I make a point or a piece of art, going to have to accept that I can't say everything. It is okay to choose an experience, show it, & that's the end of it. I'm going to write on this more later I think because I'm still unhappy with that conclusion. It leaves many things unanswered."

    "text": "- 3/6/24\n- People definitely like to think of dreams as unique things separate from the experiences of reality. They are so strange, so nonsensical, as to seem a different breed of input/output that doesn't effect the person upon waking further than, essentially, if they were told the story. Certainly, dreams are fuzzier than experiences - we remember less, we don't act ourselves, we don't have all our senses engaged - but ultimately they quickly become on par with memories a few days old; they have about the same robustness of recollection.\n- This has two results. The first is that dreams affect you, your thinking, & your reality just as much as your waking experiences. In fact, having a distinction here is arbitrarily categorical - dreams are experiences the same as waking life is experiences, & you are affected by both. Dreams \"feel different\" sure, but would you say your experiences while under the influence of drugs aren’t actual experiences? Holding dreams separately is a symptom of our categorization & projected symbolism of the world. They are their own experiences that can be learned from, analyzed, respected, etc.\n- This brings me to the next result; it seems dreams don't really impact us that much however. The craziness & nonsensical nature doesn't noticeably change how we act or what we do on a regular basis, doesn't shape our view of reality, etc. The realization from this is that \"regular\" waking experiences don't impact that much either - doubly so, since we view them as \"regular\"! Just like dreams, waking experiences impact us most while we are in them, & after they are over, they become \"just a memory\" that only impacts us inversely proportionally to how much on our current experience is impacting us. We hold experiences for a long time, but experiences don't hold us for long time. \n- In conjunction with the Daoist view of self, there is no enduring self who \"collects\" experiences & continually grows from them. There is just a selective array of memories floating in the background of what ever experience is currently ongoing. Since you're always getting experiences, the sense of a self \"apart\" from the experiences who is \"having\" the experiences is absurd & redundant. Yet, it is for this same reason we can say there are no concrete experiences & the self is simply the through line of all the experiences \"in a row\" - since there is no baseline from which to \"measure\" the experiences from, they have no qualities at all, and we can see this throughline for an exciting but formless void."

    "text": "- 3/3/24\n- There's an incongruence in how I view myself as, or not as, equals with other people. I used to chronically think of myself as less than the people around me. I have gotten better at that, but not completely, & I view myself as an equal to the people around me with one part of my mind while simultaneously the other part still views myself as less, leading to a conflict under the surface in any social situation. I consider myself an equal to others as far as I a real human being with valid emotions & thoughts & experiences just like them, & the same in reverse.\n- However, I simultaneously don't view myself an equal to them as far as I still look to others for reassurance on the things that I say/do. Part of this is assuming that anything I do exists by itself as an absolute truth and I will be given no chance to explain or justify or learn, & in conjunction with this, that perceptions or judgements of my actions & words are indicative of my value human being - I categorically cannot be anyone’s equal, when I live in a world where my value is determined by their view of me. I defer to others, get their point of view first, test the waters oh so slowly - if I do something wrong & don't have a way out, I might as well die.\n- So much of true actions - all of them - happen without thinking. However, I know that I am imperfect & that therefore some actions will be problematic, & since I view my value to be determined by other's views of me, I can't do anything problematic or I will have less value. Therefore I police my words & actions before they have a chance to form, meaning I never truly act myself and keep myself in a self made cage of timidity where nobody knows “who I am,\" but the very act of showing them makes \"who I am” worth less. Not only is this a symptom of me thinking I'm not their equal - or, as is the conflict here, I will no longer be their equal the instant I decide to act their equal - but it simultaneously is a sign of distrust & lack of faith in others to think that they won't \"hear me out\" & see the person (me) behind their actions.\n- It's actually worse than I thought; to police my actions & restrain myself is to keep myself at a higher perceived value than others, but to open myself & attempt to show my worth is actually to reverse the roles & make others worth more than me. It's a me perverted sort of egotistical self defense.\n- On top of this, my view of \"equals\" is skewed in the first place. I view me being someone's equal as me being able to \"match\" them on things. i.e. if someone is loud & comedic & commanding in social situations, I \"should\" be able to match them on that if I'm their equal. However I apply this to everyone around me simultaneously (because \"we are all equal\") meaning I essentially try to match everyone's best aspects. Obviously I can't to this, so I feel inadequate & like I'm not of equal value as those around me. Another aspect is matching people's lows, which is just as problematic. Especially bad w groups of friends, because aside from me not being able to match everyone's highs & lows, some of them are mutually exclusive meaning I will always lose! Being someone's equal doesn't mean matching them.\n- Separate but related issue is a self starter issue - I was used to in the past absorbing info from people, recognizing the value of the inputs I got from others, & using them to better myself. Eventually, I was able to generate things by myself, & I realized the importance of being able to to that. However, I've \"overshot\" as far as I unconsciously try to only take new things from myself, & how I have to now convince myself that other's ideas are worth taking in & absorbing."

I have been trying for some time to drop my obsession with right & wrong, & it seems only to make my mind more inclined to think about them. Obsessing over what I \"should\" do, or if a thought or action is \"in accordance\" with dropping right & wrong - the nature of how I'm parsing this stuff is in itself oxymoronic. Writing & processing this right now is checking the \"you're doing something right\" box in my head, even though I wish it wouldn't. Not processing this for that very reason, however, is blatantly wrong - but how can I say that when that very sentence is rooted in ideas of right & wrong?

    "text": "- 2/26/24\n- It's hard to understand, or even unheard of, for many people that you can be unhealthy mentally. It's obvious how the body can be unhealthy; you feel it, you can see it, it affects what & how you are able to move & operate. However, the mind is rarely given the same empathy. I think this comes from the fact that the mind isn't often viewed as it's \"own thing.\" For many people I feel, the mind is reduced to sensory input & our ability to connect them, & is the same for every body. They think everybody has the \"same mind”, that it's a given for every body, & most importantly that it's it's essentially just a channel. A thing that is a channel for thoughts & emotions, but that has no importance of itself. The mind is seen as a bowl, which is unbroken insofar as it can hold liquid, & the liquid is our thoughts, which in essence are reflective of us. Therefore, nothing can be wrong in their eyes with the mind, only with the thoughts therein, but because the thoughts (or, from an outsider's perspective, words & actions) are equal to the person themselves, if anything is wrong with the thoughts then it's with the person as a whole.\n- Maybe it's better explained from the perspective an an unhealthy person with this mindset looking inward. To them, it's very simple: the fact that they can think ”whatever they want” is proof enough that their mind is functioning how it's supposed to. There is no thought given to patterns or cause of thinking - as long as their thoughts aren't obviously obstructed (which they rarely are) then nothing is wrong - which is where trying to compare an unhealthy mind to an unhealthy body falls apart, because the same is not true for the body.\n- In short, the mind for them is not the thing doing the thinking but is the action of thinking, which means that to them, a mind is healthy as long as it is thinking & responding & processing, no matter how perverted those things might be. Since all minds are able to to those three things, then there is no conception of an unhealthy mind to these people.\n- This is further complicated by two things. The first is that people's egos are strong & will work hard to convince them that what they're doing is correct & there's nothing faulty with how they think, which obscures much of what is wrong or can be analysed. &, second, if someone doesn't behave according to what they think is correct, it is seen as a refusal to do it rather than an inability or difference in understanding or some other complication, which further reinforces the idea that be anything \"wrong\" comes from the person & not their mind."

    "text": "- 2/11/24\n- I've come to realize a strong difference between \"types\" of out: practice, constructed, & accidental or realized.\n- Practice: This is straight forward, & is the least connected to actual art. Practice of technical skills & application of techniques. You want to get better at some aspect of your field of art & so purposely engage in it. The focus here is on the process of creation rather than the creation itself. This can be either rigorous & intentional, such as practicing perspective or doing color studies, or unintentional, such as drawing lines with water on a piece of paper that dry & disappear minutes after being drawn. The former hones process & skill, while the second is done simply to engage in creation without any intention or thought of creating an end product (overlaps with accidental/realized).\n- Constructed: You sit down & intentionally come up with an idea from scratch & follow through with it. You start with no idea, & purposefully make an idea & bring it to life. You use the skills you honed in practice & put them together to create a skillful whole. This is often a sort of logical approach to creation: the focus is on the creation that is made rather than the process of creating.\n- Accidental/Realized: The focus is neither on the process of creation nor the creation itself. Something conceptual or artistic or meaningful is realized or stumbled upon in unrelated life, & is brought to life via the chosen method of art. The process & creation are mere conduits to express this third thing. It is not preplanned or expected, & thought of what is being created doesn't exist until after it has been created. The focus is on something unrelated to the art, & it is essentially just the artist's familiarity or skill with the art medium that caused them to choose it to express said unrelated thing. \n- These 3 things are actually very good analogs to the level 1/level 2/level 3 thing.\n- To practice is level 1. No greater thing is being created & the purpose for the art doesn't extend beyond what is created. The focus is short, near sighted, & greedy. Everything is simply a single piece for the sake of being a single piece.\n- Constructed is level 2. It is often very artificial & carries only synthetic meaning. The purpose is on creating a larger whole, but the starting point is not a larger whole itself. A larger whole is attempted to be constricted ad hoc through the combination of small pieces. This construction is logical in a way that places more importance on the accuracy of the creation than the \"feel\" of the creation. If practice/level 1 is singular puzzle pieces, constructed/level 2 is combinations of puzzle pieces that are put together based on their shape without regard for whether the image printed on top matches, & there are no edge pieces so that the only border is the edges of the table it was created upon, or is shaved flat into the lumpy outer pieces.\n- Accidental/realization is level 3, & is what level 2 trying to be but failing to do so by the very fact that it is trying. A larger whole is realized first, & necessary pieces are put together not by skill or skill or logic logic but by understanding & necessity of how the must be put together to create the final piece. The art is not in the creation or what is created, but the impression of what is created - what it leaves you with. It is similar to level 1 in the sense that even though it is is made out of many smaller pieces, it essentially ends as one large piece by virtue of it's starting point being one large cohesive idea or realization\n- An addendum to level 2: it is not the case that it has no edge pieces. Rather, almost the opposite: it loves having edge pieces. The edges of the puzzle created are meant to justify the existence of the image contained but only serve to contain the puzzle itself - it's a self contained completed piece that cannot then be fit into any larger puzzle, unlike level 3 which essentially uses small pieces to create one huge piece that can be used by the viewer in their own life.\n- It's important to note that you shouldn't be striving for level 3 all the time. I'll admit it's the most impactful, but biological human beings cannot simply intuit their way to masterpieces over & over & over in succession. Sometimes you simply aren't in that mindspace, want to do something else, or have something that has to be taken care of. Sometimes you want to practice a shape & nothing more. Sometimes you want the logical approach of constructing something an aesthetic but meaningless or unoriginal. Sometimes you simply aren't in the mood for “really impact” art, sometimes you just want to have fun - & that’s okay! Life is not & shouldn't be a stream of level 3 production. You're only able to even reach level 3 the first place by experience of level 2, level 1, or unrelated things. \n- If level 3 is the huge puzzle piece made of many smaller ones, you have to give yourself time to find/gather/create/stumble into/fuck up your way into more small pieces & different viewpoints/understandings of those pieces & how different ones fit together or how pieces in general behave."

The concept of only being able to understand contextualize something well enough to explain it to others once you have progressed past it and are currently processing the next thing that the completion of processing said thing opened up for you.\n- Being on a step means you know what it's like to step onto it & be on it, but you don't yet know what it's like to step off of it, which is an integral part of understanding the step as a whole. This means you are in a constant cycle of only crystallizing your understanding of something when you naturally move to the next thing. While you're still \"in a thing” you don’t know how it will end or where it will go or what it's like as a whole, which means that any attempt to \"\"finish the step\" & \"complete processing\" is ultimately in vain & is guesswork because you don't yet know what the completion of the processing looks like!\n- You will only ever know what the end of something will look like once it has ended, so attempts to preordain or construct the end before you get there will all fail & prevent you from reaching the end."

I know what this means from a distance - the minutia of each song when properly focused on and absorbed, give you drastically different impressions even within the same hard beat genre. For me/[other friend]/outsiders, the beats sound incredibly similar & repetitive- fast beats, complex rhythms, texture, etc. But for [friend], who has experience listening to this type of music, the nuances affect him much more.\n- This is why, in a sense, I don't fell a pull towards embracing that type of music he listens to. On the surface, yes, I will never get the same experiences he has because of the uniqueness of the music he listens to. On the other hand, I get the same experience of nuances & atmosphere in things/subjects/mediums that I have devoted myself to that he never will. Visual art creation, etc.\n- It's almost like the differences between experiences are just as if not more important than each experience in isolation themselves. Because of his baseline in hard techno beats, he can listen to one that reminds him of a beautiful peaceful field, even as fast & hard as the beats are. Like wise, I can view a complex work of art that reminds me of a peaceful beautiful field. However, I wouldn't get that from the song he heard, & he wouldn't get it from the artwork I saw. Our impressions come not from the absolute isolated experience of the art, but from the deviation of that specific piece from the learned baseline experience in that art form/taste.\n- Which brings us back to the question of if we can access all experiences from a specific baseline container of experience. \n- The reason this is a question in the first place is because of the nuance of looking at it from the perspective of differences between experiences rather than the absolute experiences themselves. The fact that me & [friend], each in our own self contained area of baseline experience, can nevertheless use our depth of experience in that field to draw drastically different impressions from ever more nuanced details points to the importance of ones journey through life being the feel of the journey itself rather than the specifics of the path being walked. While everyone has very different concrete experiences, what binds us together is our experience of the difference between those experiences.\n- Therefore, even though the answer to the question is technically obviously no, I realize that that question is actually irrelevant considering the importance of differences between experiences rather than the experiences themselves, or in broader terms, the experience of experiencing rather than the experiences experienced.\n- Practically though, what I can take away from this is a way to approach working in an art piece that consists of a collection of individual pieces. When viewing a collection, the art lies more in the contrast between the elements of the collection - the story told between the rather than the elements themselves. A hammer on a nail only carries impact from the swing that preceded it, and it’s that impact which causes us to jump."

If an experience causes you to focus on it, then your thoughts will be on the experience primarily. This means the majority of our thoughts are reactionary.\n- This becomes a problem when you're constantly experiencing something intensive or taking something in. If your thoughts are always occupied with what you're currently doing, then you never have a chance to think about what you \"want to\" think about, or more importantly, never have time to process!\n- Never having time to process is a huge issue. You are literally got properly assimilating anything you go through. You are going from experience to experience to thing to thing, never stopping to reflect on anything. You never get a breather, never get a reset, never get to just \"hold\" a previous experience in the hands of your mind & turn it over & examine it in peace. If you’re constantly occupied, experiences only stay in the hands of your mind long enough to be grabbed & tossed into the past, never to be looked at again. These experiences, tossed into the backseat, never disappear. You may forget specifics, sure, but they continue to sit in the back seat. They pile up, leave marks & smudges behind. Just because you never look at the backseat doesn't mean the experiences there aren't in the same car as you!\n- I can't stress this enough; if you don't make time to simply think & process, you *will not process*.

Before, I said that thinking about something makes you more likely to indulge in the thing. This seems like the opposite, & in large part it is. Having the possibility of indulging in something makes you want to indulge in it. Having my computer screen on in front of me makes me more likely to use my computer than if it were off in front of me. Engaging in a task makes you think about the task makes you engage you the task.\n- That last sentence is the telling part that it's not actually the reverse of before. Engaging in a task or having the possibility doesn't make you want to engage in a task, it makes you think about the task & brings it to your awareness, which in turn makes you want to engage in the task.\n- Trying to find a more general way to phrase that, because the conclusion is much more fundamental than that specific language makes it seem. I think, in short, experiences make you think about those experiences. Your thoughts of the experiences also make you think about those experiences. Simply having an experience in your mind gives it more control over you whether you like the experience or not.\n- Let me clarify that before I attempt to simplify it. We only ever experience what we experience. Everything we know & understand come from our own experiences. Our thoughts come entirely from what we have experienced - they are influenced based on our input. We experience our thoughts, so our internal thoughts are just as much an input as external experiences are- they are both, in short, experiences.\n- With this, we also have to take into account recency. Experiences that you're currently in affect you a lot more, which makes sense - the current experience is saturating all your sensory inputs, while past experiences only are inputs insofar as they're currently in your thoughts. Recent but not immediate experiences impact you more than distant past experiences through the fact that the emotions they caused (another input) are still lingering, or your thoughts from when they happened are still surfacing & continuing, or the effects of the experience are still obviously present, or simply the human memory fades with time!\n- In short, experiences influence our thoughts in the direction of that experience. This is both a conclusion & an epiphany.\n- I can't overstate how important this actually is, even though I've made it seem like an interesting but inconsequential realization. If you're reading you'll think about the content & themes of the book. If you book at porn, you’ll think about porn & get horny. If you look at a sponge, you’ll think about sponges!\n- Your thoughts & their origins are completely arbitrarily based on what you're experiencing! If you \"want\" to do something, it might be the case that you don't actually want to do something but it's simply on your mind. And since your thoughts are their own experiences & inputs, they cause desires simply by existing. So much of your desires & actions & thoughts don't come from \"you\" & are simply results of experiences & your own thoughts!"

As I became more engaged in drawing, the urge to eat lessened and lessened, until paradoxically the latent idea of “I want to eat” became stronger than the actual urge to eat.\n- This is the telling part - after drawing, I had the thought of “I could just look at what snacks I have to see if I still want to eat.” HUH?? A) my conscious mind doesn’t want to anymore, so I have no reason to, but also B) OBVIOUSLY I’m going to want to eat if I look at the snacks! So if I don’t want to eat, why would I do so? The only reason I contemplated looking at the snacks was because I was thinking about eating, even though I didn’t really want to eat anymore. Thinking leads to interaction! Interaction doesn’t lead to interaction - if you’re interacting, you’re already there. It’s thinking about interacting that leads to interacting.\n- If I woke up and had no thought at all in my mind of eating, I wouldn’t want to! It’s that simple. You’re not driven to engage with something if it’s not on your mind. Or conversely, you’re driven to engage with something because you think about it."

    "text": "- 1/30/24\n- It's impossible to have a perfect day, and I should stop striving for it. By this, I mean all my infatuation with a perfect \"alone day\" where I don't talk to anybody all day & have a productive & recharging day by myself. This fantasy was especially strong when I worked at [workplace] - which makes sense, I was inundated with social interaction most of every day & rarely had time to myself.\n- I am not in that position anymore. I have most of the time to myself now, living essentially by myself (no contact w roommates) with plenty of time to rise slow & take my time & luxuriate in silence. The telling part is that my days are often unsatisfying even by myself. I have somehow made the onus of my recharging on the simple fact of me being alone, which is so for removed from reality. I have pushed a large vague sum of symptom (tired, unfocused, not productive) onto the scapegoat of \"I just need a good day alone\" when that is so not correct.\n- Not only will a single \"good day alone\" not magically fix everything (am I just going to be live waiting for recharge days? I have to live and interact with people in the succeeding days, & this implies that interaction w people is bad for me when that's not true) but a day alone isn’t going to magically be perfect! There have been plenty of instances where I've had a day to myself & fucked around wasting time & flitting from thing to thing & playing random games etc. A core reason why I’ve had this notion that social interaction is \"bad\" in some sense is because I can't create during it. Wrong on TWO accounts. Number 1, the fact that I don’t create on alone days sometimes proves that the real issue of me being unfocused & unproductive is something entirely aside from whether or not I am being social. And #2, I can create while I'm with people, & the main problem is that I've been stopping myself from doing so. The difference is that I create different things while being social than when alone, which is good because all things in moderation - if I do solo creation solo creation solo creation I'm going to burn out & become isolated & ungrounded.\n- Back to stopping myself from social creation - this is mainly to do with conversations & initiation. The latter I've already talked about in depth recently, but the former is something I'm still struggling with (especially since it relates to the latter). I have trouble starting conversations, because things I would want to share & talk about are really just ideas that I've made & created in my own head by myself for myself, so I don't know how to \"talk about them with others\" for two reasons, A) don't know how to make it a 2+ person conversation instead of just me talking at them to explain the idea & then shutting up, & B) Since I've so often thought by myself for myself, there's a lot of background groundwork in what I'm saying that I would have to get across to them first.\n- To speak on (B) first, one big thing is that it gets easier the more I talk to people (the same people). They will be able to create a through-line of my thoughts from conversation to conversation to meet me where I'm at. Secondly, honestly if my ideas require that much complicated back ground, I probably don't understand them that well myself. You understand something best when you are able to explain it to children & have them understand it, I should either crystallize my understanding of the idea so I can bring it up coherently, or just try anyway & work with them to figure out what they don't get & explain it at hoc.\n- To speak on (A), one thing is to make it easier for me to introduce a topic cold. This, I think, is literally helped by phrasing. I'm gonna try out the intro \"I've been thinking about something for a while I wanna hear your thoughts on it” which both gives me the platform to say whatever I want, & invites them to talk about it with me. Even as I say this, a “better” way is to practice allowing myself to steer & change the topic of a conversation. This relates to the initiation thing too but the real way I should be bringing up ideas I want to talk about is by mentioning them when a conversation naturally leads to them. Conversations are two people thing - allow yourself to be one of those people! And, not only that, but recognize that you can't choose which topic will be led to in a conversation. Whatever topic you happen to think of or be reminded of in a conversation necessarily means it's going to be the most natural to segue to, no matter what that topic is!\n- A problem I'm worried about is coming this from the angle of trying to \"catch up\"\" the people around me, & seeming didactic as I attempt to \"teach\" them \"my ideas\" with the end product being \"they now think like me, I'm done talking” & in explaining the problem, therein lies the solution; the goal is not to info dump on them & leave, the goal is to talk with them & hear their thoughts on the ideas & have a conversation! Just as conversations involve 2 people from the standpoint of allowing yourself to talk & influence the conversation, they also involve 2 people from the standpoint of allowing the other person to do the same!"

Just because labels are fake doesn't mean the things that they are put on top of are also fake, it's just that you have to consider the thing for what really is is before interacting with it. No labels does not mean no things. Sure, thinking of something as a flower is to reduce it to the ideas & connotations of the label. However, the thing that you labelled as a flower is still there - or rather, the experience you get from looking at & thinking about that thing, as it is, in the environment it's in, is still there.\n- Going back to \"the label thing isn't everything\"- as is the whole point of it, the \"label thing\", is just one thing. It's no more or less important than someone's feelings on the new clothes they got. Everything is equal, but that doesn't mean everything is nothing! Just shift from interacting w labels to interacting with experiences."

    "text": "- 1/27/24\n- I drove [3rd girlfriend] home when she was drunk last night, & slept next to her in bed. She was holding my hand a lot, & was very eager to hug me in bed. When she did, she draped herself over me & hugged me very close & hummed small satisfied noises to herself. She said some things about liking me & being glad that I was sleeping with her, then she hit me with \"How lucky am I?”.\n- That little sentence made me want to cry. It was small, content - not even to me, but to herself. She had me to hold - how lucky was she? Said very self assured - things were right, things were good, & all she had left to say was to muse about how lucky she was to have me. Said like chant to herself, almost. A reminder to herself. A spell, like the one from wolf children to stay a human, very innocent & simple & sincere. But with so much confidence that it wasn't said out of necessity for the outcome or eagerness, but was instead said with the comfort & pleasure & almost awe that she couldn't believe the spell was so easy & effective. Like she wasn't invoking the use of the spell, but was saying it to verbally bring it into life as a thing for her to marvel at, from absolute safety & sleepiness.\n- It was the type of pure simple act of contentedness that makes you sad. It made me want to cry out of sorrow. That things were so simple for her in that moment, that she didn't need or want anything more. \"How lucky am I?\"\" Such pure childlike bliss that it made everything else about the world around her seem dirty, cruel, uncaring in comparison. The sorrow one feels for someone so genuinely grateful for what they have, even though what they have is so pitiful & they have to deal with so much weight in their life, so much unfair weight. The sorrow you feel when you know they won't be able to stay in in that secure contentedness for long, when you know they will be faced with struggles & doubt & anger & sadness & loneliness soon enough. Which makes it all the more bittersweet to see how secure they feel in that moment. They have such great comfort & peace in their good fortune that they quickly & quietly fall asleep after expressing it. It really really brings me close to tears.\n- I was planning on writing a note here about how, in an unrelated unrelated note, I should keep in mind that she really talking about was \"her boyfriend\" & not “me” in relation to the slowly reappearing issue of her labeling me. And this is true, in part - I was definitely a \"cute object\" for her in that moment, especially with her blatantly stating her happiness that I was her \"favorite one\" & she was happy that her boyfriend was with her.\n- However, the line in question, \"How lucky am I?\" doesn't fall into this category. She sounded like she was saying it not at any ideas in her head about what was making her happy, but simply at the fact of what her life was at that moment. Laying down with someone to cuddle after a fun night with friends, in such a state of tranquil content & awe fun night with that the line was less directed at any of the parts causing those feelings, & instead simply at the feeling itself. How lucky was she to be feel like that, to be alive in that moment. How lucky was she? How lucky am I?"

    "text": "- 1/27/24\n- I, to my detriment, have a feeling that I should leave things how I found them & not leave any trace that I was there. This was an adaptive behavior while living w [stepmom] so that I wouldn't ever leave any mark or trace anywhere that she could ever call me out on.\n- Needless to say, this behavior is horrible for actual life. Take an extreme example; living w [stepmom], I saw the trash in the garage was ransacked by bear & strewn everywhere, & instead of cleaning it up I just left silently without touching anything, then of course later got in trouble because why on earth wouldn't I have cleaned up. Because, even though cleaning up was obviously the right thing to do, it would have been leaving a mark that I was there, making me responsible for something that could be traced back to me. My learned survival instinct to not leave any traces overpowered the obvious \"I should clean up” response, & I left without touching anything. Even though leaving was the wrong thing to do, I had learned to be so afraid of impacting the world to the point of irrationality that I blatantly did the \"wrong thing\" just to assuage that fear.\n- Take me today. I came back to my got & found the door open. My first instinct was to slip inside without closing it, as a remnant of that same survival instinct. Luckily, I was able to catch myself & override it, AND talk to the person who had left it open to ask if it was intentional. Not only leaving a mark, but intentionally bringing it to someone's attention. Huge W.\n- However, that was a low stakes scenario that I was already feeling confident in. Where this still plagues me is in social situations today, very much in relation to a recent entry about not taking initiative. I learned to not make marks under circumstances for fear of horrible punishment. And now, I want to cook with someone, & I can't even manage to add ingredients or help prepare of my own volition for this very reason. I find it horribly daunting to engage in a way that would influence a situation, even small menial influences. And forget doing anything against the grain or by myself or leaking anything - those are mere far off fantasies for my anxious mind.\n- There are many effects of this. I'm unable to stand up for myself, am unable to act authentically (doing so leaves mental marks on people about me & changes situations), am unable to do anything that would render me responsible for something, and in extreme cases am unable to an obviously “correct/admirable/fair\" thing flat because of latent fear."

Two, talk to her about working on the underlying issues & how they need to be addressed. Three, slightly unrelated, she does a lot of admiring & little engaging.\n- 1.

For example, you have the literal action plot of a story, & you have the messages or experiences it leaves you with. Up to this point, whenever I've written poetry or stories or tried to explain/get across an experience, I've focused on the second part. I've essentially just been stating the feelings & messages by themselves, which isn't bad by itself, but since there's absolutely no lead up or introduction to the feelings, that style of writing relies completely on just stating the stating the experience really powerfully, which is a point I'm not at yet (since I think it requires an intimate understanding of plot experience anyway) which is why I've had such a hard time adding power to what I write. I want to try focusing on getting across feelings without talking about them at all, & just talking about the plot that naturally makes you feel the feelings."

    "text": "- 1/24/24\n- I just got a harsh awakening from [friend] about how I don't put enough effort into our relationship. Any relationship, really. As far as, I rarely if ever initiate shit & put that burden doing so on those around me. Sure, I care about people & genuinely engage them when I'm with them, but I rarely if ever am the one to start things myself. That, in short, is a really toxic trait that puts the onus entirely on the other person to keep us from drifting.\n- It's not a thing of me not caring about other people, that much I know. I think it paradoxically comes from me not being able to stop spending time with people. Once I have accepted that I'm \"spending time with\" some one, I have I hard time stopping it. I essentially completely open my flow of energy to them, or at least to the time spent with them, & put the responsibility of calling an end to it on their shoulders.\n- For someone who's time spent alone & away from others matters a lot, this is a really damning mindset. It makes me scared to start things with other people because for me and where I am now that means opening up an engagement that may last 10 minutes or an hour or the rest of the day & which I don't allow myself to have much control over how the time is even spent. It makes opening an engagement with someone a really frightful & scary thing - especially with someone who will take up the time and will take a lot of my energy.\n- Now, I have to figure out why I have a hard time a) ending an engagement with someone & b) continuing the flow of that engagement.\n- To speak on a), I think a large part of it is that the other person will feel rejected if I end our time together. Side note before I forget, I have to learn to end even in the middle of having a good time because if not I'll never be able to end in the middle of a bad time. Sure, I've gotten better at saying no to hanging out if I have a low social battery or something, but that doesn’t really count; it's not ending anything it's only preventing something, & it's on the basis of \"it's better this way because we would have a bad time otherwise since I wouldn't be able to participate properly\" which is true, but shifts the responsibility onto \"I'm doing this for your sake\" instead of \"I'm doing this for my sake\" even as much as it sounds like the opposite.\n- Going back to the original side note, I'm unable to end when we're having a good time because I don't want to seem like a killjoy, especially for \"no reason\" (for myself). I also convince myself that since I'm having fun I don't want the time to end - which is true, but not only reinforces that I can't end things by myself by rejecting an opportunity for practice, but also is bad for me as point (b) above is still present.\n- Going back to not wanting to make the other person feel rejected. A related point is that I view things very transactionally & through a lens of ownership. By transactionally, I mean that assuming I initiated something, I will \"undo\" the effect of that by ending it. Instead of simply seeing the two things separate actions they are, I see them as inverses. I initiate & get +1 relationship. I end it & get -1 relationship for a net of 0. Even if it wasn't net 0, I'm still terrified of a (percieved) -1 relationship for any reason & will avoid it. which means avoiding ending engamements. \n- This is especially bad when combined with the ownership point. If someone else initiates, I view it as \"their engagement\" (even though I have an equal part of it) which of course has the assumption that it's their responsibility to close it. Not only does this deter me from ending \"some one else's\" engagement but combined with the transactional point, that would leave them with +1 relationship & me with a -1 relationship or in my fucked up mind, I would have -2 relationship. \"Holy shit avoid at all costs\" is what my mind tells me. \n- And I know it's bullshit because the same is not true in the opposite direction; I view things as transactional for myself but not others. If I opened an engagement & it was the other person who closed it, I wouldn't view them as having -2 relationship - I wouldn't give a shit! That's fine for them to do, them ending the engagement isn't a negative, it's just an action. Me viewing things as transactional for myself is evidence of low self esteem - I only view myself as worthy if I provide a \"positive\" or \"beneficial\" service to someone!\n- On the note of the other person feeling rejected - that's not the right phrasing. For them to feel rejected implies that I'm intrinsically worth having, which we just established is not true (in my head). I'm scared of them being disappointed - they were hoping for (in my mind) a service from me, & it would be my fault if I refused them that service, which makes me the cause of someone else's bad feelings, which I cannot tolerate. More on this later.\n- Speaking on point (b) though, of why I can't bring myself to influence the course of engagements. Part of this is related to the ownership point from before- since it's rarely ever \"my\" engagement, I don't feel like I have the \"authority\" to change it. Another reason is the lack of self worth from above- I should let them have & to whatever they want, because I'm not worth doing anything for my sake, or even our sake, because that includes me, things should be done by them for them because I'm not worth having anything changed or altered or done for me.\n- A huge part of it, though, is as a way to avoid responsibility. I'm afraid of doing something \"bad\" or \"boring\" because I (even though I shouldn't) tie the quality & outcome of what I do to my own worth. If I suggest doing something, or even worse I just go ahead it, & it turns out bad then that means that I'm bad & I've proven why I don't have worth! Which of course is backwards because if I suggest or do something that turns out good I don't think that reflects on me, I consider it a \"lucky pick\" or shunt responsibility to the thing itself, ”the outcome was good not me\" or “I didn’t know that would happen/someone else helped, so really I'm not responsible for us having a good time!\" \n- It's all just a big thing of avoiding responsibility- even part (a) about ending engagements, because I can't handle responsibility for things. It either has to be someone else's responsibility (and I treat them much nicer than I treat myself) or nobody's responsibility & I would rather sit in silence & let awkwardness or tension or anxiety or fatigue grow and grow and grow rather than saying a single word.\n- So, in essence, the core issues causing all of this are low self esteem & issues taking on responsibility. Which themselves are tied very close together. In fact, I would say that the responsibility issue is still just a symptom of the self esteem issue.\n- The people I'm friends with are not monsters. They are kind & understanding. They are not looking & hoping for me to fail the same way that I am to myself. I want to write more on the point of me not being able to tolerate being the cause of someone else's bad feelings, but rn I'm tired of processing & will come back to this later. There's also some thing in this mix about uncertainty & not knowing how things will turn out & not knowing how to ad hoc things, which happens when you take responsibility, but that's secondary."

    "text": "- 1/24/24\n- I live in [place], & looking out at the landscape and imagining it without houses or roads or anything human, just natural land, is moving. Particularly during the rainy and snowy season. Looking out at dusk. Wet ground, shrouded in low hanging fog. Misshapen lumps of snow & slush melting on the ground. The trees are all thin, wet, & spiky brown black against the dull metallic blue sky of a sun setting lightlessly behind a uniform sheet of cloud matter. The hills hide themselves in perpetuity, boggy earth traversed in the dark to reveal only more. Indiscriminate plant matter coating the ground, rendering the dirt invisible. \n- The only life seen are the flightful black silhouettes that glide above in ones or twos, cracking the air with piercing goose calls. Once the sun is gone, and the moon of course too balefully distant to make an appearance, the landscape is black. Nothing on this land provides light, and the stars are above the overcast layer that we are under; their light does not penetrate. The landscape is black. One solid spiky back shape covers the entire bottom half of your vision, it's height lent to it by how far it reaches into the distance, stretching many times further than you can see. The sky that intercepts is a dull dusky blue, growing closer to that same black of the landscape withwith every second you crawl deeper into the night. It's a forlorn & unnerving environment.\n- And yet, it's here that we've put our houses. And our roads. We have added to this environment small, pitifully small & sparse, yellow pinpricks of light - and a howling. A continuous screaming howling, ebbing & flowing, from whatever near or far inevitable road carries passengers in a straight line, anxiously never deviating & proceeding with haste, from one haven to mother in the underbelly of this wintry swamp.\n- Embarrassingly small spots of yellow light. Just enough for our dim eyes to make our way softly & ungainly access the well defined paths we have made for ourselves. Street lamps huddle around the edge of the path, saying this way this way, you are safe as long as you can see me. Yet the lights themselves, hoisted high in mock pride, really are desperate & frantic to distance themselves from the ground. They have no protection, yet even worse, no opposition. They are allowed to bum as steadily as they like - the only threat to stop them is whether or not they can keep going. The darkness does not snuff out any flame or light; it sits back to watch as light slowly burns through it's own fuel. Light catching its own limbs ablaze to keep itself alive, pretend it has purpose or reason to keep blazing, in a lonely & empty space so vast that it already doesn't matter. Feverishly illuminating whatever it can -terrified of that around it, yet tied to it, for how can it's light be seen, without that which the light hits - until, inevitably, it cannot perpetuate itself any more, dims, & ceases altogether, completing the self fulfilling prophecy of it's death conceived & carried through every second it was alive."

    "text": "- 1/24/24\n- \"To be a source of marvellous accidents”\n- A sentiment I agree with, but nevertheless find it hard to follow. At it's core, it's detatching the work you create from your sense of identity & allowing yourself essentially stumble your way \"by accident” into \"marvellous things.\" In regards to creation & art, this is allowing and encouraging yourself not to create things from scratch, but to allow yourself to find things. A difficulty here is being unable to \"claim ownership\" or responsibility for the things you create.\n- I have done well divorcing my identity from the bad things I do - people make mistakes, are ignorant of simply don't care about things some times, & this is for obvious reasons not any sort of reflection on their \"worth\" as a person. It's more difficult to do this same detachment process from the good things you to as well, though. We are naturally inclined to \"cling onto” the good things we create as evidence of our worth & or “superior ability\" to make wonderful things. But really, at their core, the good things we do are no more related to us than the bad things. So many of the works of art I'm so proud of are simply things I \"realized\" or that \"came to me\" or were already present in some form in nature or mind, much like a traveler discovering a beautiful, hidden grove. They can show their discovery to others, but they didn’t make the grove, they only found it already formed.\n- This of course mirrors the original quote; finding groves like these are marvellous accidents. We have to get rid of the basic idea of self-creation & ownership to allow ourselves to organically & quite by accident realize whatever magnificent things we may realize. We are not intentional creators of the marvellous, we are accidental sources through which the marvellous is realized.\n- This brings into question for me where focus & practice & refinement belong here. Taken at face value, this implies we should \"stop trying\" & not bother with iterative creative processes because to put in effort is to occlude the accidental nature of creation. Why bother learning focus & learning how to \"enter flow\" of creation when it's an accident whether or not a \"fully formed marvellous thing\" will appear to us?\n- The answer, I think, is that the question is faulty because it implies that effort and accidents are mutually exclusive. In a focused & effortful iterative process of creation, I can stumble upon something marvellous that I wasn't planning to. The nature of finding things \"by accident\" doesn't mean that it has to be all at once spontaneously & unpredictably from nothing. It speaks more to not having a fixed & finished end goal idea in mind when creating. Creation is necessarily a process where you can't arrive at the finish point in one leap, you can only organically grow & build what you already have, regardless of what form it's in. All in. All you can do is look at what is in front of you & intuit (an action *not from you*) or that by trial & error (guessing & finding the answer *by accident*) what should be added next. Trying to think many leaps ahead places many assumptive constraints on the process & railroads you into a certain path artificially, without regard for what forks in the path may be presented along the way. Create by considering each fork in the path as it's owndestination, not a a \"right or wrong\" choice on your way to the \"actual\" destination.\n- Note from the future: another obvious application of effort here is in technical skill and physical ability to give form to the marvellous accident. To inuit your way into realizing something incredible to be shared is quite a different thing from proceeding to actually make the thing, and effort helps to refine both our mental processes of translating the idea into medium, and the physical work within the medium. The technical skill is altogether second to the intuitive process of creation, yet necessary in some aspect (diminishing returns) to produce for yourself/others."

    "text": "- 1/23/24\n- I'm reintroducing myself to the activities that I have at my disposal. It's been a long time since I had a long dedicated amount of time on the scale of not days, but weeks, with which to do “whatever I want.\" It's almost startlingly new for me.\n- I'm realizing why it's so hard for me to \"just do one activity\" for a day. I always thought that a big problem for myself was that I didn't have enough activities to choose from. I thought that I had couldn't invest myself in anything because I didn't have enough things in which to invest myself - I wouldn't be in the mood to draw, & would therefore be left with \"nothing to do”. My solution was to give myself lots of things to do; drawing, writing coding, journaling, gaming, reading, organizing, each with 5 sub activities & 10 choices of what flavor to do. I could sketch or do bullet art or animate or continue a project or design something new or anything else. If I chose to play a game I could play Melee or Minecraft or Disco Elysium or SMT IV or pokemon (Emerald or Rutile Ruby) or Donkey Kong Country or any of the 10s to 100s of unplayed games on my backlog. \n- Surely, if I couldn't focus on something, I could simply switch activities until I found something I could focus on! It wasn't a problem with my discipline, it was the fault of choosing the wrong activity! I made lists of everything I wanted to do, organized what was best to do when, what I should do with limited time or at work, I made a program that would randomly generate for me an activity to to based on an internal list that I wrote with probabilities & weights & everything! Look at how productive & versatile & prolific I was!\n- God, it's so draining. No wonder I find it so hard to do anything. I've made it hard for myself to devote time to anything because I've trained myself to simply switch activities when I lose focus. And no wonder I find it difficult to devote myself to a single activity, because by doing so, I’m ignoring 99 other things that I could doing, & I should finish quickly so I can hurry to another thing! Pure quantity over quality. I'm so scared of of dying without being able to do everything I want to that I'm hunting myself to death just so in my scramble away from the knife I'll trample activities to the ground just to touch as many as possible with one footstep each. Nothing is gained except continuous & ever more desperate novelty. I never make it past the first sip - I've never heard of the bottom of the bottle, I only know what it's like to see the blurred reflection of a frenzied terrified beast on the surface of the liquid, pretending to savor the swirling depths from afar even while the only thing seeping into my brain is the dopamine hit of changing colors & tastes.\n- Just as the 5 colors blind man's sight, so too do the 5 activities halt a man's growth. I make discrete categories of things & indulge myself in the categories themselves rather than simply doing what I want, what ever that may be, I partition ways to spend my time into finite assumption-filled frameworks & then feel upset when I have trouble coloring outside the lines.\n- I lose the ability for a unique meta to develop by defining what the meta will be ahead of time. I ostensibly want to see what will organically come from my brain, yet am terrified of the fact that once a certain tree grows somewhere, no other tree can grow there. By fulfilling an opportunity & letting it come tofruition, I am somehow more focused on the countless other possibilities that will never be fulfilled in it's place. I have become terrified of the stream I float down."

This observation doesn't come from place of derision or contempt, & I certainly don't claim to different. It just strikes me how fundamentally alone everyone is, yet how people are distracted from the fact most of the time by inputs & goals & actions.\n- People will comment on a picture to someone else. What they say is a quick passing thought, not something they engineered, but whatever thought happened to pop into their mind based on the input. They didn't choose to have the thought, they simply had it. They say it aloud out of a belief that what they have to say is at all important, that it actually means anything. Out of adherence to social customs that someone told them about once, that they have a finite collection of specific memories only of instances where they have seen these customs play out, have made generalization of \"the custom\" based only on these many specific instances (which they then take take to be the generalization), social customs which dictate that the silence must be broken and their thoughts are to be spoken.\n- They say it aloud out of a fear of what response they will get from the person they are speaking to. The notion that something will be said back to them, which they will then interpret in their own way. The desire to impress the other person, to seem insightful or worthy, to seem interesting, to make them pleased. This other person which they only know by a specific collection of experiences in which they got input and only input from the other person, & yet take to understand that they know who the other person \"is\".\n- The other person responds with a thumbs up. They were told once that it's an expression of good will, & they want to express good will right now, so they curl their fingers into the sign & raise their hand.\n- The first person sees the thumbs up, recalls what they know about thumbs ups (they have a completely different collection of memories that points them to the meaning of a thumbs up, but never the less the meaning their memories point to is one of good will, so they understand it as such), & wanting to show the other person that they acknowledge their thumbs up, give them a smile in return.\n- When I look at exchanges of actions like these, I see an undercurrent of anxiety & ritual underneath it all. They're all ultimately attempts to \"do the right thing\" in whatever the situation is, where that \"right thing” is something completely arbitrary that they were told or shown by people who who in turn were told or shown by others. A constant desire for control & order over things that they don't understand the underlying mechanisms of so they rely on what patterns they've seen & what they've gotten as input as a way of pretending to themselves that they understand how the things work. \n- From the future: It’s worth nothing that the feelings themselves are human. The desire to show good will in something inherent to humans innately, it’s how we function; thumbs ups are not innate to us. That is the arbitrary things we fall back on as a vehicle to show the good will."

    "text": "- 1/20/24\n- Just lost that minecraft world I made summer 2023 with the big ornate yellow & purple structures & the 4 directional create-heavy underground. I'm at a place of I was never going to play that world again, yet I'm genuinely devastated that it’s gone. I put so much time and effort and care into that world, it really hurts to just have it all gone with no warning.\n- It's a purely sentimental loss - like I said, I was likely never going to play it again. And yes, I am upset that now I'll never get to show it to anybody like [3rd girlfriend] (which is how I found out), but... I'm trying to figure out where the pain is primarily coming from: the fact that I lost it, or the fact that others won't be able to see it. Because I would still be upset if I lost it without having anyone I wanted to show it to. However, if I was able to show [3rd girlfriend] the world still somehow even though I never got to access it again, that would help the hurt I'm feeling right now a lot, even though sure I'd still be upset.\n- This tells me I'm upset for personal sentimental reasons (I lost \"my\" world) & separately for interpersonal reasons ([3rd girlfriend] will never know how Cool that world was).\n- The second reason is pretty straightforward. Ultimately, it's essentially the feeling of not being able to share art that I made with someone. The reason I made & put effort into the world in the first place is for myself. I never had any intention of sharing it with anyone, hence why there aren't even any pictures or screenshots of it anywhere. It was a work of art by myself for myself, intentionally or not, that was very much experiential. Yes, it looked very pretty & polished, but the entire medium was a game. The reason I was attached to it was because of the continuous experience of playing the game and the work I put in, which is transient - even if I had the world now, it would only be a reminder of it’s actual importance, which was the time I spent in it. That’s ultimately not something which can be shared with others & not something which I can \"keep\" for myself either - the time has passed & all I have are memories of it. The memories might be clearer if I still had the world but again, it would only strengthen the memories, which is an irrelevant attachment-based thing separate from the reason it was important to me in the first place. \n- Therefore, being upset that I can't share it with [3rd girlfriend] is ultimately a gross egocentric worry that I don’t have something to make myself seem impressive to her because ultimately the negative feeling here is less “[3rd girlfriend] won't see how cool it was\" & more \"[3rd girlfriend] wont see how cool *my work* was”, which is such a perverted misrepresentation of why the world was important to me in the first place. I processed the first reason during that anyway. Importance of world is that I had fun doing it."

Plenty of time for socialization & creation, which I am extremely excited for. Likely even enough free time to play games again too! I am so thrilled about this.\n- However, I need to be careful. I know it will be so easy to get so caught caught up in it all that I become uncentered & unfocused. I can easily see myself hitting walls with my art & writing, becoming unsatisfied with how I conduct myself socially, becoming frustrated with a dwindling attention span, etc. [note from the future LMAOOO THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED] I definitely need discipline this semester if I'm going to make the most of it all.\n- More than discipline, however, I need to start meditating again. Remaining centered, & being able to focus & put effort into things for long periods of time are the most crucial thing for me right now. I literally cannot afford to be fucking around & shit.\n- That being said, I recognize the danger of placing too much importance on this semester. Telling myself \"this is the time! you have to make the most of !!!!\" will place critically damaging weight & responsibility & stress on my mind when creating art & stuff, There will be wasted time, I will make a lot of duds, I will get stuck, I won't get to some things that I want to, I will be unsure. That's okay."

    "text": "- 1/18/24\n- Annoyed that I'm somehow still struggling with going on my phone first thing in the morning. It's something I've been trying to kick for a while & hasn't worked or taken hold. I've successfully worked on many \"harder\" things, but a simple phone usage problem is still haunting me. I've started cataloguing what I do on my phone when I use it in the morning. It's mostly messages. (not even sending messages really, just being on there & reading them), safari (to look random things), & photos/reddit. Occasionally I'll open a random social media, not to browse but just to look at my own profile, or open my notes app to either peruse or write something small. So really, the overall vibe of what I'm doing on there is mild organization, & going through my preexisting digital presence to remind/affirm myself of what's there.\n- That makes sense, honestly, considering that I've unwittingly made a \"base\" of sorts on my phone. I've built a lot of things digitally; relationships, websites, art, social presences, history/memories, journals, infrastructure - that I've started unwittingly tying myself to. I end up associating a lot of of productive endeavors with \"myself\", so that becomes dangerous (in general, yes, but also) when my creative endeavors are largely on my phone to the point of associating my phone with myself. Huge issue!! It qualifies the notes & safari too - that's just me to the little online empire I've become invested in.\n- No wonder it's so hard to not use it - it's scary being unmoored from your identity. You feel lost & out of touch. My little ape brain does want to be reminded of who I am & what I'm doing immediately after waking up so that it knows how to act. It doesn't know what to do with itself before the software boots up, which is sad, because I used to be way more comfortable with that. I had no problem being just hardware for large portions of my day.\n- It also makes sense considering I've tied myself more & more closely with my social relationships ([friend], [3rd girlfriend], etc.) & a large way I communicate with them is on my phone! I inherently want to check my phone when I wake to see if they or else has contacted me. Why is this? Sure, it's because in case of an emergency of something time sensitive I want to contact them quickly. However, emergencies have rarely ever happened, & I would keep checking my phone even if I was assured that nothing time sensitive would ever occur. That means the reason is really not wanting to be left out, FOMO, etc. I simply want to know what's going on & \"catch up\". I read all my sisters texts even when I know they're just about random tiktoks. I have to remind myself that it's okay to be \"out of the loop\" for a while- two hours is not going to make any difference. The effect will be the same, I'll have all the same information, whether I check at 8:00 or 10:00. Regardless of the time that I check, when I check, I will have checked. And the ending point will be the exact same."

    "text": "- 1/11/24\n- Coming to a point where I want to stop clarifying to myself if I feel \"more or less centered lately.\" Not in the sense that I want to stop checking in on myself- indeed, recently that's been even more important to me after a long slump because I didn't check in on myself. What I mean is that I want to stop obsessing over if my trajectory is \"good\" or not, especially since the underlying assumption there is that there's a goal I'm trying to reach. I don't want to strive for a goal, I want to simply live well, and worrying about where I'm at on this nebulously defined continuum of \"doing well\" to \"doing bad\" is doing nothing but providing unnecessary distractions & arbitrarity to what I'm doing that cloud my vision.\n- Similar sentiment to how I want to stop asking \"Why would someone to do that????” about an unhealthy behavior if I know why someone would do that & the only purpose that question serves is to affirm to both myself & the others around me that I know it's unhealthy. Past a certain point its a purely performative and self jerking question, & I am definitely past that point. Which makes me question what \"should” I do instead?? The short answer is that the question is irrelevant; there's nothing that I \"should\" do whenever a situation that prompts me to want to ask that comes up, I should just sit with the feeling and react according to that specific situation.\n- Longer answer, honestly, is I should figure out how to make art from it. That will probably get me to process the feeling way better from the standpoint of where I'm at mentally than simple logical surmising ever will. Making effective art about feelings is one of the best ways, or at least best indicator of the fact that you've properly processed & understand the feeling & it's context."

Annoyed at [sister] for not being able to face me in a confrontation, or at [3rd girlfriend] for not giving herself \"enough\" days alone, even though these things have little to do with me. The connection to me is obviously what's causing it. I wouldn't feel anything other than general human empathy if it was someone I never did or would know who didn’t give themselves enough time. It's a self centered / selfish worry of mine then, it has to be - I only care about these people because they're close to me, annoyed because their choices impact me too. My relationship with [sister] is strained, [3rd girlfriend] may be drained when we try to spend time together. \n- This is ultimately rooted in me wanting things go \"my way\" which is something that's been an issue for me a lot recently. I've lost touch with the part of me that \"makes the best\" of whatever version of a situation I am given or at least \"appreciates it for what it is.” I guess this ultimately comes from attachment to a certain view of the future, as well an inflated sense of self importance, self righteousness, & I think, self imposed responsibility."

    "text": "- 1/3/24\n- Depression & self pity are really scary. They hijack & influence how you understand & process the world on a very deep level. They make you feel like you deserve something from the world but make you hate yourself for wanting it, not to mention draining your energy to get it & making you feel like you don't deserve it anyway. Your thoughts become warped, in every pathway of thought presented to you there’s cries of sorrow lining the sides & thick mud around your feet. You think about you, you, you, incessantly. It becomes hard for you to imagine the world existing outside of your immediate environment. It's like being stuck in a house of mirrors. You see your own shitty situation in everything in a very involuntarily self-centered way, & it’s hard to experience anything without the mass of self pity in your mind absorbing it. \n- It spawns, or perhaps is created by, a feeling of unfairness so deep and potent that it becomes impossible to challenge it. It's not you against the unfairness, it's you clinging to the feeling of unfairness, imagining it as the mast of a lone ship facing the world, when really it's more like you holding on to a heavy boulder dragging you down to the bottom of a secluded lake, while you're too despondent to even hurl the insults at the world that you'd wish to say, not that any ears would hear them anyway.

I've never been a big holiday person, but I at least want to spend the season with people I care about & have fun with them. In a world where people are always in the middle of something & are busy, we at least have like a week where everyone gets some time off to finally be able to do things together & talk & have fun without worrying about responsibilities. And it is precisely during this time that I cannot talk with or spend time with anybody. It feels like everybody finally got a pass to relax & have fun & talk & I'm the only person left out. \n- It's really really isolating & frustrating. It's a very powerless feeling that makes me feel a sense of isolation I haven’t felt in a while -  a darkly affirmative depression that causes my mind to tell me that of course this would happen, this is better, everyone is having a good time without you, [myself] will be missing christmas & will be missing all the planned events & will be missing new years & everyone else is better for it but don't worry he'll be back once it's all fucking over & people are tired & have already had their fun & are back to being busy & yeah [myself] I want to see you I can fit fit you in thursday after work (I plans this weekend) but it doesn't matter because the fun has already passed.

    "text": "- 12/31/23\n- I've been alone at [isolated place] waiting for my car to get fixed for over a week now & it's getting to me. The past four days specifically have been me working on my neocities website nonstop, only pausing to eat & sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night last night & with in seconds I was trying to figure out how to put a drop shadow on a transparent image in HTML, which is also what I was thinking about before I fell asleep. Like a dead fish who's muscles keep flopping, or a spider leg ripped off that continues to bend & flex. It feels like death throes of the mind that continue right where they left off the second I am awake. It's scary - what you've been experiencing recently really is your everything. It takes effort to return to that clear meditation-esque baseline - in fact, it takes effort to even want to return to that. Your mind wants to keep doing what it's been doing - or I guess more accurately feels like it only can keep doing what it's been doing.\n- I think this is why people get stuck on self destructive paths. Your processing mind can immerse itself in a certain activity or environment long enough to become its everything. However, your experiential mind still feels emotions & functions as normal. It makes sense that when this happens, if your experiential mind starts feeling negative emotions (which is prob more likely in this state anyway), your processing mind doesn't have the attention or bandwidth to either process or even notice these feelings in the first place. However, that's not to say the emotions don't still affect your processing mind, leading it to either look for solutions within the framework of the cached everything, or just find distractions, again within that frame work.\n- That is another reason that I think meditation is so important. It essentially clears everything, while giving you the tools to manage even when a cache does built up. i.e. teaching you how to not be affected by it in the first place. However, you still need to keep doing it, because managing the cache is a losing battle in the long term - you also need to regularly clear it!"

Until now I've just gotten into relationships with people because I like them, with no critical thought as to why, or where I want it to go, or anything.\n- This stems from when I got a text from [3rd girlfriend] & instinctively was super happy & eager to read it. Why? I didn't necessarily think the content of the message was going to be spectacular; I wasn't waiting on anything & we weren’t in the middle of any conversation. That means the only reason I was excited was because of the mere fact that it was from [3rd girlfriend], which begs the question why.\n- The answer of course is that I wasn't actually excited that it was from [3rd girlfriend], I was excited that it was my girlfriend. After all, I don't get that happy when I get messages from [3rd girlfriend]. I'm often intrigued, but it doesn't spike any feelings of happy anticipation. Those feelings are caused solely by the label attached to [3rd girlfriend].\n- As I've talked about before, putting a label a relationship is ultimately a coping mechanism to assure yourself of stability & security in comfort & love. Therefore, to enter into a labelled relationship is to implicitly accept to some significant extent the fact that you will be labeling them & that they will be labeling you. If you weren't okay with that labeling going on or didn't feel the need for it, that would be synonymous with not wanting or feeling a need for the relationship in the first place.\n- In that case, what role to these labels have in life if I'm aware that they're just a coping mechanism? & for how long? How much should you try to distance yourself from things like this and how much do you just say you need to cope for a little longer?"

    "text": "- 12/26/23\n- I'm revisiting the Level 2 thing, & I'm gonna be tying in why I think that I'm good at traversing it. I think my strength in navigating situations lies in my ability to see something, particularly \"art,\" as \"what it is.\" I'm good at not putting frameworks or labels on things, & instead just seeing what I'm actually working with. No abstractions or generalizations, but instead infinite specificity into the specific thing I am dealing with. Because of this, I am able to bypass the Big Pitfall of level 2, which is when you lean so hard into labels that you use them as your playing pieces instead of the pieces themselves. Because I can refresh & see the pieces as the base, I can continue using them as the base.\n- An effect of this is that while I traverse level 2 quickly & effectively, I nevertheless do it without aim. I don't have a conception of what my end goal is or where I'm trying to go, I'm always purely in what I'm doing at that moment.\n- This is good because I don't get distracted easily by artificial goals or endpoints I set for myself, I am able to learn very purely & naturally, following one step into the next into the next, without side paths because \"I think I should.\" Because of this, any endpoints I do reach are very sound & intuitively understood.\n- This is bad, however, because I can easily go down wrong paths without realizing, & often accept assumptions that I shouldn't be accepting. Because I never (rarely) purposely critique the framework, I fall into traps of accepting faulty frameworks from myself or others without even realizing there is framework. This ties into, and/or is just a different view on my adaptability & how it can be my greatest weakness at times. Because I go step by step & not path by path, I can eventually look up & realize how the fuck did I let it get this bad. This is especially true if the framework comes from an external environment or person. I generally trust frameworks I came up with (course correcting for trauma) but I too often unquestioningly accept external frameworks when I really shouldn't.\n- This is also why [friend] & other generalizers are bad at level 2. Because they can easily extrapolate patterns, they are good at standing in level 1 & seeing how it \"would look\" at level 3, & so make level 3 seem very intuitive & approachable, hence why they are \"shuttlers\" - they meet you at the beginning at and the end. However, they still have to cross level 2 to be at level 3 themselves, & their strengths at level 1 & 3 are exactly what make them really easily fall into the Big Pitfalls of level 2. They easily get way too wrapped up in labels & abstractions & generalizations & lose grounding.\n- While [friend] & generalizers are more attractive to people on lower levels because he makes level 3 seem achievable, he's not good at guiding you on the journey, because the journey is level 2. That's why I can be really good at actually getting people to level 3 even though I don't have his charisma bc I can meet people where they are & naturally take them through the steps they need to take at that point in their journey, instead of just pointing alluringly to the end & saying \"well, this is where you need to get.\" However, it's still hard for me b/c of previous; I sometimes meet people ”too much” where they are & I let them/myselves take wrong steps because I trust/accept too much that I should be questioning."

I'm not even really figuring it out with them - I'm helping them figure it out themselves. That's how I got into my suggestion era - l engaged people with the mindset of providing answers, & if my answer wasn't correct, I'd just try to give a second answer, or I'd try & make them \"see\" the first one. That's also why I hated that era: that's a shitty thing to do at worst, & is misguided at best. Not only do I not have all the information, but the information that I do have is implicitly biased by them, likely through the very preconceptions & thought patterns causing the problem in the first place.\n- Talking with someone shouldn't be me trying to explain something that the other person \"doesn't get,\" it should be me figuring out why they don't get it (assuming they actually don't get it), & pointing out issues in their thinking that, when they're confronted about it & correct it, they naturally realize the thing themselves. However, thats not even really true: often times I shouldn't have a point or idea I'm trying to explain in the first place, I should just be pitching hypotheses to them & figuring out with them if it's true or not.\n- However, that's not even really true; I should really just be getting them to talk about their issues in a constructive way that basically makes them realize the answer while explaining things to me. In a crude phrasing, I shouldn't be walking away from those conversations with an accomplishment; *they* should. I shouldn't be flexing my listening and analysis skills to figure it out for them, I should be using my listening and analysis skills to get them to figure it out for themselves. If I really believe that answers hurt, but realizations help, then why do I try so hard to give answers?\n- The answer is something something self esteem & ego.

To change what you're making you have to change how you make it, which requires analyzing how you're making it, understanding the implications of that, & manipulating it into something new. You can't change the pieces, you can only change how you put them together. It requires an understating of the extent and limitations of each piece. It necessitates understanding where the effect of the piece ends & where the effect of your placement of the piece begins. With limited tools all you can do is make a stroke. Make another stroke. Make another stroke. Make another stroke. For the outcome to be more than just a bunch of strokes, since you can't make the strokes change, *you* have to change. You have to learn the system and its effects. Because all you're given is fundamentals, & since the only way to change what you produce meaningfully is by understanding & manipulating the base system, you are forced to understand & learn to manipulate the very fundamentals of the medium.\n- With a single brush, you have to learn how to manipulate the brush. With a single sound/note, you have to learn how to manipulate the note to achieve a different outcome.\n- But with a large palette, you can achieve a large change in outcome without changing your approach at all. With access to 1000s of samples you can drop in you can get an entirely different sound instantly. With hundreds of different brushes, you can get an entirely different look by simply choosing a different brush. In both cases your approach is exactly the same: make another stroke. Play another note. With a limited palette, staying with this approach would mean all your products would stagnate & be very similar & rudimentary. But by being able to swap the piece you're holding at will, you're able to get drastically different products without changing your approach at all. You get rewarded for changing your tool rather than changing how you use your tool, meaning you never actually the understand the system or learn how to manipulate it."

These are the first layer of meta-ideas created by the connection of level 1 ideas.\n- (Level 1: ideas. Level 2: Meta ideas from ideas.

This doesn't stop you from trying to figure it out, though, & trying to gain mastery over it. It is in this search, trying to gain mastery rather than simply trying to engage yourself in the topic, that keeps you from progressing in the topic. You focus too much on the meaning, implication, & connection of things that you lose sight of what the things are. You start using the connections between playing pieces as your pieces rather than the actual pieces themselves - which of course means nothing ever actually gets moved. You try to sum up and catalog what you see and \"finish the job\" of understanding the entire broad topic, falling to see that there is no job to finish. So close, yet so far. So focused on how the branches split, you forget that the only important fact is that there are branches, & they are simply a small part of the tree.

In short, now that you've you've realized that you can group the patterns & connections into a seemingly finite group of interconnected labels, you become compelled to work with the labels themselves, trying to find & manipulate more connections between them. \n- However, by doing so, you forget that the labels you created are merely a way of organizing the newly expanded field you have walked into, & by focusing on them - by trying to \"float above the field\" so as to \"see it better\" - you leave the field completely. You lose touch with the actual things between which you found the connections that caused the labels in the first place, & therefore lose all grounding & support for the labels. This leads to manipulating the labels in nonsensical and artificial ways not at all in accordance with the things that the labels were supposed to organize/describe. \n- Again, in this stage, you simultaneously have the most amount of paths available to you thus for, & yet feel as though you have the least, since you try to take paths via the labels - but since the labels were artificial & arbitrary from the start, they don't lead to anything & make you feel boxed in to the framework you have constructed. So many actual paths open, but you try to \"outsmart\" the field by creating your own paths, which are all inevitably quick dead ends, because they are no longer grounded in what the field actually is."

    "text": "- 12/21/23\n- Right now, I'm struck by the peculiarity of celebrities & how we will pay attention to the news of what's going in other people's lives that we will never see & will never effect us. People used to eagerly listen to radio broadcasts to hear whether the birth of the Empresses' daughter went well or not, & would cheer exultantly as one if it did. People today regularly check their phones for updates on daily occurrences of many, many peoples everyday lives & events.\n- I'm struck by how the relationship is purely one way, & is purely knowledge. Most people will never remotely even catch a glimpse in real life of various celebrities, any more than a serf would ever see the princess' daughter. The celebrities exist purely in these people's mind as an isolated source of arbitrary information completely disconnected from anything in their life. For the most part, it holds as much weight as an AI generating another random sentence of a made up story every once in a while; it might as well not be real. The only difference is that a name & a face can be attached celebrity, & it's \"happening somewhere\". It's essentially idolism of the completely arbitrary.\n- To speak to the human aspect, celebrities are being seen as role models to many for how to act. Why else dote on both what they're doing, & the reactions of others to it? It gives you information on what other people are are doing, which you can use to figure out what you should do. It gives you information on how other people react & feel about it, which informs you how you should react & feel about it. The killer is that it comes from the \"important people.\" Those who are \"better than\" and \"more meaningful than\" the people in your actual life around you. Even though, to state the obvious, celebrities don't know \"what's going on\" any more than you or anyone else does.\n- Stepping back again from the human aspect. I am fascinated by the nature of the relationship of collective humans placing immense weight on the purely informational relationship from one single person. It crosses into religion in my mind. Yes, these celebrities are real somewhere, but to the majority of people on earth, that doesn't matter because the celebrity exists only within the stream of information they look at & nothing else. The celebrities become gods & the media outlets the faithful, incredibly prolific oracles.\n- It's just so striking to me because it's so fake and inconsequential. The information received is meaningless for anything in people's actual lives, save for how they will interpret the next bit of information."

    "text": "- 12/17/23\n- I've been thinking a lot recently about how important it is to make connections. I wrote an entry about this in the Hissho notebook, & said I'd come back to it once I knew how to phrase it better - here I am. Two main reasons have come to me. One, about strength of connections, and the other, about the distance of the connections.\n- About the strength of connections, this relates to how the mind can really only hold very few ideas at the same time with any effectiveness. With few exceptions, We can only hold a handful of points at a time; new points either don't stick, completely bump a different point out, or lower the clarity with which we look at what our mind is holding. Therefore, how do we get around this? Having a strong enough connection between a few ideas allows us to consolidate that whole connected structure into a single coherent idea in our minds. Connections of this type, if effective, are often implicit. (I will be calling this consolidated connected structure a meta-idea or meta-point from now on). \n- Making the connection holding the meta-idea together explicit holds the connection apart from the ideas it connects, which at best serves as an artificial generalization & at worse doesn't do anything to reduce the number of points we are holding & instead just adds a new unnecessary one. Only when the connection is implicit - that is, understood so completely & innately so as to bypass the need for mental justification or explanation - can the mind effectively treat the meta-idea as a single idea without losing the intricacies of the ideas that made it up.\n- The importance of being able to (for most people, who learned that operating by instinct or feel is bad, this actually just translates to allowing themselves to) create & work with these meta-ideas is self evident, but I'll give a rudimentary example. Say the human mind can only effectively hold & work with 5 ideas at a time. this would be the normal limit of how deep connections & new ideas could really go; 5 ideas deep. However, if the connection between 3 of those ideas is so strong & implicit that that whole connected cluster can be treated as a single unit - that is, a meta-idea - they can be made into a single idea. This reduces the number of held ideas in this mind to 3 (3 distinct ideas became 1 meta-idea: 5 - 3 + 1 = 3), allowing for two more ideas, Connections can now be made between these 5 new ideas (two old, two new, one meta) but since the meta-idea holds 3 ideas, connections between these 5 ideas are really connections made between 7 ideas, meaning connections can be much deeper! (broader)?\n- This is also where I revisit what I said about the connections being implicit is important, to offer another reason why. The connections holding ideas together being implicit means they were formed by whatever underlying connections the mind understands inherently as existing between the ideas, separate from the explicit frameworks & viewpoints of the conscious mind which are at best artificial & arbitrary, & at worst irrational & biased.\n- For these connections to be explicit means using those frameworks & viewpoints, & serves more to solidify connections you think *should* be there than connections that *are* there. This means the deeper into explicitly-connected meta-ideas you go, the more & more you're using your own artificial generalizations, which essentially just means you quickly end up circle-jerking with yourself.\n- Going back to the second point though, about the distance of connections made. For this I think of a volumetric pyramid example, where the height of the newer idea realized from connecting two different ideas is proportional to the distance apart those two ideas are. Visual example on next page.\n- ---\n- VISUAL EXAMPLE\n- ---\n- Essentially, the further apart the two ideas that you manage to connect, the higher & more broadly-encompassing the idea you realize is.\n- Imagine that when playing a fighting game competitively you connect lots of ideas in that field about how to play, good strategies in-game, lessons learned, etc. These are all good and enable to play better, but are all completely localized to the game & can't be transferred to other areas of your life. This is because since all the ideas connected are close together (in the same cluster) the ideas realized will all be low-height - that is, only high enough to cover ideas in that same cluster, & will never be high/broad enough, to reveal higher/broader \"truths\"/ideas about any other areas of your life.\n- Compare this to connecting three ideas, one from the competitive game, one from writing, & one from eating or social interactions or something. Because the ideas connected are so much further apart, the idea realized will be much higher & encompass, or can be transferred to, much more. this is because when connected ideas are very far apart, the realization nearly necessarily cannot be narrow & localized; it is instead a much more base realization about experiences & patterns in general. One can imagine that the far-reaching realization from competitive games, writing, & social interactions can also be applied to an unfamiliar situation in a romantic relationship or learning a new skill. One cannot imagine the same for the narrow idea realized solely from playing the competitive game.\n- When combined with the first topic of connections being strong enough to form meta-ideas (which, by the way, essentially are \"the ideas realized from different clusters\" from the second topic) we can see how much more of life you are able to connect, & therefore how much more fundamental & universal your understanding of experiences in general becomes, & how effectively you can apply this understanding to new areas in your life. You become able to work effectively with very deep concepts & quickly \"master\" new areas of experience.\n- This premise is what enables powerful art - deep thoughts that connect many far apart ideas can speak to a very fundamental aspect of human existence, & when this deep thought is expressed by someone through a medium (especially one they have high technical mastery over, but not necessarily) we get incredible classic works of art.\n- Changing topic, this brings to mind the concept of level 1 vs. level 2 vs. level 3.\n- Level one as your initial understanding of things. Your first thoughts, immediate impressions with little to no analysis. You take things as-is, no matter how they're presented to you. You have no concept of how they're connected, no concept of why they exist, no concept of where they fit in, no concept of what they really even are. Pure experience of things as they appear and your first thoughts on them. These are the lowest ideas in the previous diagram - you get these directly from your involvement with surface level source material.\n- Level 1 actions are ones you don't think about & have no concept of why you're doing them (in a contextual sense) or what the actual effect of them are. You're acting off pure ego, no analysis. What do you want *then*, what do you think *then*. No thought of how you feel or why, just what those things make you want to do - and you do them.\n- Level 1 is the trunk of the tree - where it all starts. Nothing is defined & nothing is built off anything else. No generalizations or abstractions can be formed because it is so surface level. All you know is the immediate specific experiences you have had & that's it. You don't know where it will go yet, what it will cause; you don't even have a conception of it going anywhere or causing anything. A punch is just a punch, nothing more.\n- Level 3 is very similar to level 1, but we will come to that later. Level 3 is the leaves & fruit of the tree that level 1 is the trunk of. It's the ideas realized not by connecting ideas, but by connecting meta- ideas. They grasp a very fundamental aspect of a large part of experience. Not only have pieces been put together, but the entire completed puzzle is being used as a piece to yet another puzzle. You are able to substitute in high level ideas in place of their their lower level counterparts seamlessly, able to understand the same situations in a much broader context.\n- Level 3 actions become effortless in a sense because they are driven innately by the understanding of how each piece fits where & why. You understand how the entire system works with so much mastery that you also know how to fuck with it. You know what can be subsituted in where, what things will compliment it, what things can be taken away, & what the effect any of those things will have on the entire system.\n- On level 3 being the fruit of the tree; it is both the highest culmination of the entire full grown tree, but contains the core seed of the truth/beginning of seed in general. While level 1 is a specific trunk, level 3 is the understanding of every trunk. Each individual level 3 leaf can blend together to seem like one cohesive canopy, obscuring the messy maze of branches that hold them. A punch is just a punch, & nothing more.\n- Despite being told, & believing, that I'm \"good at level 2\", I find it the most complicated to explain & understand explicitly. I'll get back to that later."

    "text": "- 12/17/23\n- Finally starting to actually process my relationship with [1st girlfriend]. There's this certain feeling I have always associated with my time with her - this sort of naïve childlike wonder & adventure that brings to mind unconditional support & love & laughter & excitement 24/7 with someone else. Hugging often, seeing the world while holding hands, cuddled on bright days & dark nights. It's very comforting, very safe, very kind. Porter Robinson's \"Nurture\".\n- It's not until recently that I've realized that's a fake feeling. You can't actually experience that with anyone in any meaningful capacity, & even if you do, that environment doesn't let you grow or change or accomplish anything. It's idealistic without considering anything about how it would affect you long-term.\n- It’s a sporadic feeling that you experience in isolation in certain moments with someone else, or with friends during one night frolicking around where you shouldn't, excitement mixed with danger mixed with support. But you still have to go quietly to sleep after, & you'll wake up & have to brush your teeth & eat & take a shower. You experience the feeling waking up slowly with some one & cuddling & kissing for hours. Later in the day you'll still have to go shopping for food & make a call you don't want to & wipe your ass after you shit. You'll still have go to work. You'll still feel dull guilt over not working on that project you've been neglecting, not reading that book you've been meaning to. Your head will still feel fuzzy with undirected insatiable longing for \"something else\".\n- Wanting that Nurture feeling (what I'll be it from now on) as a way of life is ultimately a really big cope, especially since the emphasis is often doing it all with some one else. *Your* unconditional ride or die, *your* comfort person, *your* friend you do everything with, *your* lover you're joined at the hip with with eternal heart eyes & kisses that are always warm. Wanting that, & wanting a person like that, actually completely throws away both your & the other person's identity. You want to give up responsibility of your own life for some nebulous idea of everlasting comfort & serenity & love. \n- What a huge fucking cope! Your daydream is literally just \"I'll be happy with someone else forever.\" Huh? That is so not grounded in reality. The daydream promises you happiness and everlasting comfort & eternal companionship without any effort, any struggle, any change. It's the ideal wish of someone struggling with trauma & loneliness who is incapable of working on them selves. It's an easy, hands-free, net positive promise that all their problems will be solved without an iota of effort! ...if they can only find the right person!\n- And therein lies the real damnation of the wish, even more so than braindead longing for everlasting happiness; the idea that it will come from someone else. You wont have to put in any effort to heal yourself & grow - you just have to find someone so magical & compassionate & fun that it will bypass all that shit for you! You'll never have to face reality, you'll never have to take responsibility for anything you do, because they will be full of unending forgiveness & hugs & kisses & cuddles!\n- It's obvious how maladaptive this coping mechanism is. There are no specifics of how that life will be, no thought for practical considerations, no inward reflection, no reasoning of how that will affect you long term. It's like hoping for a blank piece of paper with only the words \"you are now happy & fulfilled forever.\" It's a blanket wish for blind comfort - & not even a healthy comfort. This nurture wish is entirely focused on the relationship between the two people in question, & not at all on the people themselves. \n- It's literally the opposite of a real-life meaningful relationship, where the people love each other for who they are as people & nothing more, to the extent that they'd be sad, sure, but ultimately understanding & accepting if they left forever the next day. In this nurture wish, the focus is *only* on the attachment & not the other person. If, in this wish, the other person were to leave, you'd be devastated & despondent. If a completely different person was then switched out and offered you everything the other person did, you would immediately be just as happy as you were with the original person. This is because you don't see the other person as an actual person in this scenario, you see them as a label for love, comfort, & fun. Anything & anyone that you can effectively transfer that label to would work just as well for you.\n- Here in lies the proof of how fake this daydream is; in this situation, you allow & accept the other person to label you just much as you label them. You allow yourself to be their label for love, comfort, & fun in the exact same way. However, as you would soon find out, being treated that way is awful. You lose all individuality. You become unable to follow your own goals, be upset or unhappy, have an off day, or do anything that doesn't fit into behavior of the label that the other person expects from you. You become unable to see them or yourself as a real person, & so lose touch with yourself completely.\n- However, because you are a real person, you will behave as such - you will get upset & unhappy & angry often (without knowing why because of how deep you are in the delusion), youll do things solely for your own benefit, & - because you see the other person as a label instead of a real human - you'll treat them as a label & treat them terribly & take advantage of them. Because you've accepted that you aren't a real person & are a static label & therefore will never work on yourself, the only way for these things to smooth out is for the other person to throw themselves away completely & forgive you for everything. If they do so, they sink lower & resentment builds towards you. If they don't, *you* sink lower & resentment builds towards *them*. \n- The same is true in the opposite direction for when they inevitably treat you as a mere label & nothing more, the same way you did to them. As this resentment on both sides builds up, you both become angry because the perfect ideal relationship isn't playing out (you guys aren't both throwing away your identity to live perfectly in accordance with these labels to fulfill this vague & ultimately unrealistic idyllic life which only really serves to engage you both in a fantasy of eternal comfort & happiness & security) & you will figure \"they just aren't the night one, I have to find who I'm *really* meant to be with\" thus starting the fantasy all over again with someone new, but a little more jaded & discontent with yourself & life in general this time.\n- Back to the intro; this exact situation is what happened between me and [1st girlfriend]. We lasted way longer than people in this situation normally would have though because a) we were both passive & b) we were able to displace the growing resentment onto the fact that it was a long distance relationship, telling ourselves that \"it will all be perfect once we meet each other in person finally\".\n- The reason I've been stuck on it so long is because I was able to short circuit before we got to that last step of eventually realizing it \"won't work\" & leaving each other. By ejecting last minute to drown my sorrows in a physical relationship with [2nd girlfriend] (who fulfilled my need for labels more effectively since she wasn't long distance), my mental association with my relationship with [1st girlfriend] forever remained in the state of \"we had/would have had the perfect Nurture relationship\" & I never processed that a) that is certainly not what our relationship was while we were in it, we were both just so completely mutually engaged in the daydream we never realized it wasn't real, & b) it wouldn't have magically turned into that had we met in real life, however strongly & for however long I clung that idea anyway. Only now am I able to realize that relationship for the mutual 4-year-long coping mechanism that it really was, & say with finality this time; Goodbye, [1st girlfriend].\n- Future note: this was not goodbye. You’re still struggling with her."

    "text": "- 12/16/23\n- Okay, I'm coming back to it. The praise issue is really just a small case in a larger issue that is believing & identifying with what other people say about you. I think I focused on the praise issue because it was striking to me to be exasperated of praise, when I would have thought I would have always liked it. It felt fake, like people were only complimenting the label they put on me. It feels selfish of them! They come in & impose whatever label they personally happen to see me as onto me, & then tell me it's a good thing & that I should keep being that thing. That doesn't take into account the real everchanging person they're talking to at all. And worse, they expect you to feed in & become more like whatever they said.\n- This is especially bad for me because of my people pleasing tendencies & my adaptability. The former causes me to latch onto praises specifically & consider them to be a \"goal\" for how I should act, & the latter causes me to follow through & start actually acting like that while quelling any rebellion from my real self.\n- As mentioned before though, this isn't only with praises. It's also true for insults, or random comments, etc. Insults work in a reverse direction if you take them seriously, giving you a label to propel yourself away from (&, of course, toward a different label). However, any of this is only true if you accept & integrate what the other person says at face value. Any comment made about you boxes you only as much as you let it. You can hear praise & not let it alter what you think of yourself, but instead alter your view of how the other person thinks of you. That's the only actual information you get when a comment is made about you - anything you apply to yourself from hearing it is entirely extrapolation."

    "text": "- 12/15/23\n- A minor switch has happened with how I approach writing in this book. I've been building a \"back log\" of topics that I want to write about, which I'm wary of because I know my propensity to turn backlogs into their own self standing project that I never fully expand upon. It's like a bastardized child of how I originally processed things, by writing my full thoughts out on my phone. I now relegate thoughts to just a bullet point & tell myself come back to them later, which means that by intending to do full processing later, all I'm actually doing is no processing at all when I could at least half-process it on my phone. Especially since I mostly process things that happen to be on my mind in the moment, because that means I'm already starting to process it, rather than processing things I choose randomly from a list.\n- I'm really over hearing people say nice things about me. I'm always happy to hear them, but it's a thing of it's only serving to boost a fake ego. It encourages doing things for external praise instead of internal reward, & also solidifies in your head your connection to this external identity that other people perceive, even though it's not you! It's not even real! Praise often comes from people praising the labels they put on you, so hearing/accepting those labels serves to associate your identity with those labels. Really bad! Labels are fake & unchanging, they are not you at all! Obviously praise can actually be directed at you, but I'll come back to that. \n- Often people praise you by saying you are a certain type of person, or you act a certain way. This is often just because they enjoy the labels that they perceive to act that way, & apply the labels to you, which they view as good thing. But they're still labels! They're putting you on a mini podium & then praising you for being there. They would praise anyone for being there because they're not actually praising you for being there, they're directing their praise of the podium at you instead because the podium doesn't have ears! And you, by accepting this praise, allow yourself to associate yourself with the subjective labels they placed on you in response to your actions because of how they happened to interpret them. Arbitrary arbitrary. You actually forfeit responsibility over yourself & your actions to the label, & in extent to the other person, by \"buying in\".\n- I'll come back to this topic later, especially how it pertains to a) \"true\" praise about you, & b) anything anybody says about you, not just positive praise."

    "text": "- 12/11/23\n- I'm feeling this wrenching in my stomach that signals fear of ending current era of my life. It's not a new feeling to me. I don't feel it often, but it's familiar. The feeling signals that I'm \"not ready\" to leave the current era in my life, or am scared to do so. What stands out to me about this time though is how intense the feeling is, & how early it started. Things usually hit me \"pretty late\" & even while there is always a build up of anxiety, sometimes it doesn't even hit me until after the transition is over. However, this time, I still have a few weeks left (almost 2) and the feeling is already almost all-pervasive. It's affecting my actions & my perceptions. It feels very final & like it will be the beginning of a long spiral or something like that, as though once I leave [city] this time I'll be permanently stepping down from plateau I've been on for a while. Like I'll be going underground, not for a visit before I return back to home above ground, but to live there, and my time above ground will now be the visits. \n- It's a scary, damning feeling that makes me feel very alone & makes me feel like what I'm building now is futile because it is about to be thrown in a closet to \"come back to later\" even while I know the closet locks from the inside. And the light will always be suffocatingly pale & & bright & clean & empty outside. \n- I look down & I see a man. I look inside & see alleys of thought in a multilayered district that now demands governance & fuel & organization, instead of the open sand pit with objects layed out in the sun like it used to be. The inside of my mind no longer feels all brightly lit - the canopy of built up experience is tall enough to create a shadowy underbrush whether I want it to or not. The sheer presence of more objects, of more matter in the area, seems to take away possibilities rather than add more. Once they are placed, the air no longer opens it's arms to this blueprint or that or perhaps all - the air has been used up, the path taken, branches blocked from the prospective future as the future that arrives and solidifies into *these* branches that leave no room for the ideas of other versions. \n- I now don't know but instead understand how as experience & accomplishments mount, possibilities & goals vanish. Just like my first entry about how even as this book now sits as a blank canvas, one day it will be filled with every choice decided, and once it reaches that state it may as well never have been empty at all. I know that this is really a blessing, & I have understood how it is so in the past & likely will in the future, but right how I feel awfully damned & trapped like the red square. I fear I will have wishes forever."

I decorated the cover with some stickers from that [place] fashion show where me & [3rd girlfriend] tried (& failed) to see [her friend] walk the stage & had to wait outside the back entrance. Anyway, I really like that the pages are kind of yellowish, & also much wider & more compact. The only thing kind of irritating so far is that once I'm writing on the right hand side of the page my right hand falls off the book & it becomes irritating to hold the pencil, but I suppose that’s not the fault of the book as much as books in general. \n- This is a pretty nothing entry since I'm writing more just because I'm excited to write in this book than because I had a reason to/something to write about. [3rd girlfriend] is (was) making tea as I was writing that & I felt self conscious about the fact that I was writing, even though she has regularly read the things I've written in my notebooks before. I think that's more just due to the fact that this entry is pretty inane. For some reason I have the feeling that the entries in this note book will be more inane & slice-of-life than the ones in the other notebook. I think this is just due to the fact that since I haven't established \"serious entries\" in this book yet I can only approach it with pre-existing associations & stereotypes, those being that due to the delicate flowery nature of the aesthetics, the contents will be just as flowery & decorative & lacking in depth. \n- Speaking of which, slightly related, I've been thinking about how it's funny that my previous notebook is now *finished* & nothing more will be written in it. I was going to continue that by saying \"it's meta has ended\" or some thing like that but the lovely part is that that isn't even true. There are still entries I want to revisit & write more about. This book I perceive to be so open & has so many branching paths, which is funny considering soon it will as \"closed & final\" as I perceive the old notebook to be now, & as soon as I reach that point with this notebook, it will be as if it was always like that."

    "text": "12/7/23\nI want to figure out why it's so hard for me to confidently explain my own thoughts feelings on ideas, even if internally I'm confident in them. I'll formulate some idea and I'll be confident enough in it to use it as a building block for other ideas in other words, an idea that I  know is good/valuable. Yet, when I try to explain them to other people, I hesitate & stutter & make excuses & act unsure in my own speaking, as though tentatively figuring it out right there, even though I know damn well what I want to say & feel damn sure of it's value.\n\nThe obvious answer is that I'm afraid of being wrong - but, in these scenarios, it's a given that I'm confident of the idea in my head, so I know I'm not wrong - & they're usually things that have no way to be \"wrong\" about them anyway, like ideas for a poem or story or view point, so what gives! The answer has to lie in that, if the other person I'm speaking to visibly reacts positively & seems engaged, I \"clear the hurdle\" & am able to talk confidently. Is it fear of people disagreeing with me? It's worth noting that the ideas I'm talking about are ones that I already feel so confident in that I would pursue anyway even if someone disagrees (barring any actual conversation where they explain why they think that & that I agree with them).\n\nThat being said, that's a new thing that I think will help me: asking people *why* they disagree (or agree) with the ideas that I bring up. Even if they disagree, having a back & forth on why will also \"clear the hurdle\" and allow me to be more confident in what I'm saying - provided I don't carry the same tentativeness into the back & forth. I don't know an elegant way to to phrase this, but at it's core it's a fear of seeming cringe or lame! How am I still dealing with that!\n\nI'm not leaving it there though - What's at the care of not wanting to seem cringe/lame/incorrect? First thought is fear of people not taking you seriously, second thought is fear of responsibility. I want to say it's a fear that people will discredit your ideas even though you're so confident in them - problematic for 3 reasons. One, that places the value of your own ideas in the hands of some schmuck. You should care about the points they'd bring up for why they disagree, not the fact that they disagree in the first place. Second, by fearing that, you unfairly discredit your own ideas before the other person even has a chance to to - self defeatist shit! Third, that really serves to show that you're afraid that you \"missed something obvious\" & so are pretending to lack confidence so that it's easy to go back on your own words in case you encounter resistance. That comes from a fear of conflict - you're not worried that they I will think if bad, you're worried they'll oppose, which is even more terrifying since the thing they're opposing is some thing that came entirely from you & so you attach part of your identity to it, therefore any attack on the idea you percieve as an attack you yourself. Not only is that a problem, but even deeper, is the fact that you view an attack on yourself as something to be scared of because of low self esteem & fear of conflict.\n\nSo, I've figured out the issue I think. The core of why I can't be confident when explaining my ideas is that I'm scared of a conflict in the form of a disagreement, & because I view an attack on the idea as an attack on myself, which is especially scary since I have low self esteem. (Used to having to just accept barrages of insults I couldn't defend myself against). I have agency now! I am allowed to debate & explain things to other people, because in addition to the previous things  said, this operates under the assumption that the that other. person is \"correct\" which is bullshit because not only is there not a correct viewpoint about these things, but as I discovered previously, people really don't know shit! It's just some dumbass' uninformed opinion! Holy shit [kuudzu], no way you you let that hold sway over you!"

    "text": "12/5/23\nWhy didn't I throw [name] under the bus?\n\nRelated to the above question. I've been thinking a lot lately about relationship with anger & motivation. In short, feel that my anger response is being habitually short circuited because I learned growing up (from both environment & people) that there was no point getting angry because it was pointless at best & harmful at worst. Whenever a situation arises that should prompt anger, I instead feel a self defeatist fear as the strongest emotion - fear of possible repercussions, & self defeat from recognizing the futility. However, I think I consciously feel the self defeat more - I got so efficient at supressing my anger that I've bypassed the fear response entirely. If I put thought into the situation & emotion, my behavior best represents someone reacting to fear, anxiety, avoidance, excuses, etc. But if I allow the situation to resolve without analyzing it or myself to closely, I barely recognize any emotion at all, besides a dull frustrated longing because a deep part of my brain is upset that I never *do anything* about situations like that. Part of me is also worried about it being a sort of manipulation tactic - I've weaponized my lack of anger anger & fear of repercussions into getting \"bad endings\" purposely for the purpose of garnering pity from those around me. Even though I could go deeper into analyzing the truth & nature of that conjecture, I think it's a moot point because I don't believe that it exists alongside the suppression of anger as much as because of it.\n\n[name] suggested that it's because of a lack of empathy with myself. I'm going to be honest I have no idea where to start with that, which I think means that it's right. I need to figure out what it means to have empathy for yourself & why. This also definitely solves the manipulative pity problem because being comfortable enough with my emotions to have empathy for myself means I will no longer have any desire for pity since I won't be looking for empathy outside of myself. I feel like this means that I need to be both more in touch with what I feel, but also, more confident in what I feel. This ties back to feelings of low self esteem as well - in addition to having habitually suppressed anger, I also struggle to believe that I am worth changing things for. I can feel drive to change things for other people because I have empathy for them & recognize that they are worth the effort put in to make things better for them (empathy allows me to recognize things aren't good in the first place, seeing worth gives drive to change it) but I don't feel the same towards myself. I instead take an attitude of essentially \"I'll deal with it\" or \"I'll figure it out\" & then stop myself from thinking more about the issue."

Only later, when talking to [name] about it, was the actual base assumption challenged; \"It's not my apartment, why would I care?\" People attach roles & responsibilities & frameworks to everything they do, & it's important to be able to discern them not only to know the operation of how things work in that framewark, but also if the frameworks should be used at all! \"Solving a problem\" within a framework is useless if the frame work is faulty - & the framework is almost always faulty because it was created by a single person's point of view & goals & insecurities & guesses."

Underneath that, I'm almost surprised that it actually did help her since I thought what I was saying was completely being thrown down a canyon, yet it makes sense. People recognize when they're treated as people whether they show it or not.\n\nWords have an impact, intentions have an impact. The world does not operate on absolutes & principles & facts, it operates on feelings & intentions & experiences. Engaging with people on the level of experiences carries so much more weight than engaging on the level of principles, even if the former is so much more nebulous & feels weaker logically. Every situation needs to be taken as-is, not through the lens of whatever you abstract it as!\n\nIn working through this, it's finally becoming clearer how to both recognize the arbitrariness of the world while still having compassion for & engaging in it.

It was me \"feeling bad\" that I had been trashing [name] & discrediting her as a completely autopilot shell even while she was caring so much about what I did & said. However, after examining it, even while that's true, I think a more accurate way to categorize the feeling is that I was holding myself to an unrealistically high standard of \"holiness.\" I got it into my head that I need to be a step ahead of everyone else analytically & philisoplically in relation to feelings & experiences. As though I place a burden upon myself of being a mentor & guide for for everyone else while not having that for myself. This has led to a lot of collisions with my own pride in not admitting when I'm not doing well or am immature in some area, because I tell myself that I'm \"so advanced emotionally\" that I can't possibly be doing poorly or that \"I knew that implicitly, I just haven't put it into words yet.\" Once I realized I can take truths from myself, I stopped letting myself take them from anyone else, which is a complicated thing to work through because ultimately while it is true that the only from true realizations you can have come from your own mind/experiences, it's also true that your mind wouldn't be able to do so with out input from others or the world, sometimes quite explicitly. Essentially, to summarize my original point, I have let myself believe that because I have made progress in working on myself emotionally I no longer am affected by the same human problems that every one else is.

    "text": "Thinking about human vision - it suddenly feels really small. I had a very acute sense of how we only see through two little eyes at a very specific location on our body. It seems very happenstance - living things arent innately given sight. Some have it & some don't. There's really no way to contextualize it - it is it's own base thing. Our eyes aren't meant to track extended fast motion, like looking out the side window of a fast moving car. Why would we ever have had a reason to be able to track movement like that? Never. As with everything else in our anatomy & physiology, it just is that way because it satisfied most of our needs pretty well. It was *a* solution, but the fact that it's the one we ended up with gives it importance to us. I love how arbitrary so much of our experience is - all of it, arguably.\n\nFor example, [name] was reading a book of poetry, & one poem was named \"Mozart, for example.\" I didn't read any of the poem, & didn't know how it fit in with anything. All I got was the title. Another person happened to name it that - it's not like some omniscient committee greenlit that title as the objectively correct one; they just called it that. Imagine a summary at the end of the book that runs through all the topics covered in all the poems. Mozart is listed. Mozart was not the topic though - the poem was about something else, some abstract idea or concept or feeling, & they happened to choose Mozart as the example through which to convey their message. They could have chosen Bach, or some entirely different entity entirely. The summary would have replaced that one word, Mozart, with whatever they chose to represent the message of the poem. Mozart is not important at all for what they were trying to say, which makes me amazed at how nebulous & generic what people experience really is. We attach specific nouns & words & facts to what we say so integrally that it seems they are inseperable. This is both true & not true to startling degrees. Not true because the base emotions & concepts are what really lies at the heart of experience. The poem wasn't about Mozart nor was he needed to convey the message. Something was being said that, regardless of intention or not, resonates at the root of both the author & the reader. However, the aforementioned statement is true to the extent that regardless of the message, the poem chose Mozart as the conduit for the message & not anything else. Even though it could have been anything, it wasn't; it was Mozart. For purely arbitrary reasons, Mozart is now tied to the reader's experience of the message & the poem - even more, Mozart *is*, in part, the experience of the poem. A choice so arbitrary governing so much of our experience of a thing holds so much power, however cosmically comedic. The amazing part is that this is true for absolutely every part of everything we experience. Which is why every specific, unique, arbitrary experience is so special.\n\nAnyway, going back to eyes - imagine if we had cat's eyes, or fish eyes. Visually, our would would be different. Pay attention to the wording there. Our world would not look different, it would *be* different. Since our experience of a thing is the thing for us, there is no distinction between what a thing looks like to us & what it actually is to us. Just like Mozart in the poem, even though the message is an entirely separate thing from Mozart, our experience is nevertheless specifically the combination of Mozart & the message as one entirely unique experience. Even though the things we see are an entirely separate thing from our vision, our experience is nevertheless specifically the combination of our vision & the thing as one entirely unique experience.\n\nLook at those two previous sentences again. Structured specifically to demonstrate the very concept I'm talking about. The base experience & concept I am trying to convey can be said even through two entirely separate conduits; the sense of sight, & a poem about Mozart. And yet, as the reader, your understanding of how I presented this topic was shaped entirely by those two arbitrary choices of topic, instead of a poem about books and the sense of touch!"

There's no way for me to test that one, unfortunately. No wonder so many people get \"stuck\" in small towns for their whole Iives. They're like quicksand after a while.\n\n[name] just came downstairs & I hid my journal. Do I really still have that much insecurity about it, or just about her?\n\nTalking about [my siblings] is a whole other topic, which I'll get around to some day."

I hate looking downwards because it hurts my neck. Your hands are BELOW your head, so humans have to look down to see what they're doing, we should have necks better designed to look down! I'm not talking about for looking at phones, I'm talking about writing or making things with their hands or whatever. My mind is really scattered. I just felt really just felt really bad because whatever whatever I'm in shitter fuck off mode & my brain doesn't want to focus on deep internal processing. I'm about to drive for 5 hours, hopefully I'll be able to center myself a little then. It's raining, let me watch.\n\nOkay, I'm back. Rain is so localized. It seems like rain starts & stops so slowly, but it's all just where the clouds are! I just saw it go from nothing to hard raining in 5 seconds. The cloud passed over right then! I love that. I love when it's raining on parking lots or lakes & clouds of mist roll off the surface. I don't know why that happens, I want to learn.\n\nI'm feeling better now. Looking at rain & being under an overcast sky always does a lot for me as far as centering myself. I'm glad that I don't get angry often. It's one of my least experienced emotions, more & more so as I get older. I get annoyed, yes, but I really rarely ever feel actual anger. That shit eats at your soul."

    "text": "A lot of things happened today. One realization is that I'm going sober from weed, or ig not completely sober but only in social situations (which, thankfully I don't have many). I smoked for the first time by myself in a while, I think 2 or 3 weeks. I don't like what it does. Short term it helps me process a lot things quickly, but long term it makes me unmotivated. As in, puts me in movie watching mood but not drawing mood. Overall worse than to process things sober - the things processed sober stick with you more & mean more to you. Also, the fogginess at the 2nd sucks ass. I really hate this feeling, it interrupts when I feel tired & makes me not want to create anything, despite giving me lots of ideas. I can't afford to have fuziness, I literally don't have time for it. I need to be operating well if I'm gonna even get close to doing every thing I want to do. There are more obvious important things to talk about right now, but I need to get a bit more mentally comfortable to be able to.\n\nSo I'll start with [name]. Again I haven't responded to her in a while, & I feel terrible for it. She called me today, & I didn't answer. I finally realized how incredibly draining an online relationship is for me. I think, of course, at it's core is my experience with [name]. My brain can't handle doing something like that again, I get this deep aching sorrow & fear whenever I think of talking to someone who in that moment I can only communicate to purely online. [name], [name], [my siblings]. I care about all of them, but I cannot deal with the dynamics of an online-only relationship, even if it's only that way temporary.\n\nHaving a 4-year relationship purely online when I was that young definitely left scars on my mind. Not scars that hurt per se, just scars that affect. I leaned that meaningful online relationships, existed via a secretive labelled relationship between both people, both of whom were using the other as a coping mechanism. I start feeling old old anxieties and responsibilities float up in my head and drag my perception of the world down into a lonely trench on the distant edge of a cold & desolate but, a far ways away, active warzone. It drains mental energy completely out of my mind instantaneously. It feels useless, it feels frustrating, it feels lonely, it feels guilty, it feels like deep longing that you know so completely will never ever be filled that you already grieve for yourself. It's terrifying & mind numbing to go back there."

    "text": "11/10/23\nI'm gonna start dating the entries real diary style I think. I have a lot of thoughts swirling around in my head & want to write what I can down.\n\nLast night & this morning I had a lot of \"heavy\" in depth thoughts that I was excited to write down & elaborate on. However, right now, after about 3 hours of social interaction, a lot of those thoughts have left my head & I no longer am bursting to write about them. I will anyway though, or I'll at least try to.\n\nTalking w [name] & [name] last night helped me better process or clarify a lot of thoughts I've had in my head. The idea is this; you're going through life, unhealthily but without realizing it, on autopilot almost all the time & being untruthful with your self & others, etc. When you're here, it's hard to care about other people as people instead of as objects that do things. It's easy to have sympathy for others, but at this point it's impossible to have empathy.\n\nStep 1 is regularly taking time to look at yourself & think a) what am I feeling, b) why am I feeling like this, & c) what does this feeling make me want to do? Being able to answer those three questions regardless of if you're angry, excited, nervous, etc will tell you so much about yourself. Two hard hurdles have to be overcome in this step. Hurdle #1 is the realization that sometimes, you're a shifty person. Sometimes you'll have a moment & awful clarity about a situation you've been gaslighting *yourself* about & realize \"I'm angry because I didn't get my way, & it makes me want to make them feel guilty as revenge\" and that, if you hadn't caught yourself, you would have done just that. Feelings like this are human, but being able to admit to yourself that sometimes your actions are a) shitty and b) have a *reason* but not a *justification* is a scary thing to do. It's essentially admitting failure to yourself which is terrifying & humiliating & disappointing for the human ego.\n\nThe second hurdle is kinder - it's realizing that those bad actions aren't a reflection of \"you\", & don't make you a \"bad person\". The background for this is very daoist in nature but it shows up here anyway - you are in a constant state of doing something because you feel a certain way because of a certain thing that happened. You are not constantly in a logical right state of mind whenever you act - you are contradictory, you are miscellaneous. You experience irrational urges, & follow them often without really being conscious of the urges. You are emotional. You are irrational. You are temporary & transient from moment to moment.\n\nStep 2 is really a deeper version of what I just explained. It's being able to distance \"yourself\" conceptually from the urges & emotions you experience, & recognizing the control that those urges & emotions have over you. You realize how much of your actions - of your experiences, of your life - is dictated by you thoughtlessly following those urges. Not because you're uncaring or lazy, but because you've only recently even consciously realized that those urges even exist!\n\nStep 3 follows naturally from step 2 - and the good news is that once you're at step 2, it becomes easier & more natural to reach the next steps, Step 0 to step 1 is the hardest step (I think, maybe there's a harder step down the line that I haven't reached yet. in fact I think this is the case - but this is a completely separate conversation). Regardless, step 3. This is when you realize the ramifications of step 2 - realize you've actually had so little control over your life up until this point, because it's the urges - which come not from \"you\" but from involuntary learned experiences / behaviors & from the generic human ego - that have had the most control. Along with this comes the desire to be rid of the urges.\n\nStep 4 is realizing that you can't get rid of the urges because they aren't you. They're superimposed onto you so to speak, & you have to deal with them. Therefore, you realize all you can actually to is resist the urges. To reiterate, you can't get rid of the urges, you can only get better & better at resisting them & not letting them control you.\n\nIt's at this point where I have to say what I believe underlies all these steps & enables you to move through them; meditation.\n\nMeditation, at it's core, is just you taking time to observe things for what they are without letting any analysis or reaction in. And, even if you to have a reaction, you start over & just take that reaction as the input as a thing to observe.\n\nThis is the entirety of step 1 - being able to accurately observe what you're feeling, why, & what you want to do because of it. Being able to to those three things without letting your ego override & stort justifying or analyzing or throwing up internal defense mechanisms that just serve to distort what you're actually seeing. Being able to supress that ego response is when enables you to see the situation clearly - & meditation (at the beginning (?)) is essentially just practicing supressing that ego response!\n\nAll the other steps afterwards are just you meditating too. It's you being able to see bigger & bigger contexts with the same clarity & objectiveness learned in step 1. & the great part is that this will happen naturally as you keep practicing!\n\nAlso important to note that these are not the only steps! There are other stages I have since progressed through, but they're recent enough & I haven't created strong enough connections yet to speak meaningfully on them, but I will soon.\n\nWriting this has made me realize that the ability to make connections is so important holy shit. Each step is just zooming out more & creating wider connections - & as more connections get added to the outside, the internal clusters need to be stronger & stronger to be able to be treated as a single unit instead of a collection of connections in order to function efficiently as a player in any larger inter-cluster connections. That's very abstractly worded, so I will come back to this later when I can phrase it better.\n\nThe reason it's hard for me to phrase it, though, is because this is a really high level concept that I have to pull a lot of different concepts together to get across what I want, but because these connections aren't yet strong for me, I can't translate it succinctly. This concept is a shallow area for me because it's new: best art is deeply thought about concepts being strongly connected into a new broader reaching concept that is then also thought about deeply - but that new broader concept can only be crystalized & thought about deeply if the connections are strong! & it can only become powerful because the things being connected were all deep. Right now I have to strengthen the connections to then be able to solidify what I'm saying right now & communicate it effectively in context (this section has been all without context). The good part though is that just writing this is helping strengthen the connections. I love life, it makes me so excited.\n\nA quick point on what I was writing about the steps before - it's just you being able to have a bigger & bigger scope when you observe things. Step 0 is there's literally no scope at all - you're not observing anything. Step 1 is basically the first time that you have any scope at all, & the first time you really properly observe anything at all."

    "text": "I've been thinking about how new habits are picked up - especially ones you've been \"meaning to\" start. For example, I've been doing a lot better at not just consistently eating enough, but eating better/healthier. This isn't because I told myself, while I was in the mindset that caused me to eat unhealthily, that \"you have to eat healthy!\" & trying to force myself to do to. Since I wasnt in a mindset to care about eating healthily I wasn't going to. What caused the change was that I changed the mindset by a) informing myself on the topic & b) making it easy for me to do so, but (a) is the most important. I started researching the topic of nutrition, not actually with the goal of eating healthy, but because I wanted to know more about various topics, & I happened to pick nutrition first. As I learned more, I started simply being aware of the ramifications of my actions because I understood the underlying mechanisms better.\n\nThere's no push away from unhealthy foods and towards healthy foods if, to you, food is just food. Sure, you know your body needs fat, but... what even is fat. You don't know, & so you basically don't form connections between the food you eat & it's components.\n\nNow, I know that MUF & PUF are good fats, SF is okay in moderation, & TF is awful. I know what they each do, & I know what common foods have which. Just knowing that information will alter your preferences next time you pick out food - now that you have a better understanding of which foods are better for you and why, you will naturally choose the better option! (b) helped, since it made it easier to act upon the knowledge of (a) by finding easy places to get food & taught me which foods to get, but it was (a) that caused the mindset shift which is, ultimately, the most important part."

    "text": "Today, I went out to go meditate under the [Name] Evergreen tree. I walked briskly the entire way there, all excited to have a good meditation session, as though the walk there wasn't just as important as me being there.\n\nIt started slow, but then I entered a very clear headed & focused state. There were birds all around, flitting in the trees. I watched them without analysis or purpose. I closed my eyes again. It was when two people walked by that I instinctively changed my pose to be \"less obvious\" out of self consciousness, then I reflected on said experience, & in doing so entered a new incredibly open and fruitful mindset. I felt simultaneously detached & connected to everything around me. I acknowleded the presence of the people & my feelings toward them being there without acting on anything. I heard sounds nearby, recognized the urge to open my eyes & see what made the sounds, but didn't act upon them. I was perfectly observant of everything. In this state I reexperienced the realization of how nothing actually is building to anything. The sameness & nothingness that characterizes everything, even the attempts to describe said sameness & nothingness. I had, by myself, another experience of \"laughing at the root of it all\" - literally laughing out loud to myself about it. It's incredible.\n\nI then opened my eyes. On a singular leaf on a tall thin stalk directly before me sat a spider. I watched as it stood still, then slowly maneuvered itself, then stood still again. Silk trailed out behind it's body into the air; it was a windy day. It stood like that for a while. Then, in a remarkably beautiful display of spindly dexterity & coordination, it used 3 or 4 legs - however many it had to spare, considering how it was standing - to collect the floating strand of silk back up. It turned around, then expelled another stand of silk to fly into the air, I realized this is how spiders start their webs. They float one end of a strand of silk into the air, hoping it will catch on a nearby surface. They learn if they succeeded by ravelling the strand back in - if they feel resistance it caught on something!\n\nIt reeled back in this second strand, then expelled another. I sat watching it's body - I couldn't tell where the strand was, as it was so small. It reeled it back in, offering another angle of the sight; it's legs were painted directly of me. I saw it suddenly move, & begin moving through the air towards me. The silk strand had hit something, & the anchor pont was my face. Instinctive primate alarm rose through the tranquility & wonder in me. I am not a strong enough meditator to resist all uges, yet. After moving my head to confirm that it was traversing, rather quickly, through the air directly to my face, I had a strong flare of fear & panic, and I shot up, stumbling away. I regret doing this. I can only imagine how wonderful it would have been to allow it to use my face as a foundation for it's web. That sounds like something from a dream. I think I would have \"reached something\" or \"broken through\" if I was able to resist the fear to run away, the same way I resisted the anxious urges when I heard people nearby. However, I suppose I would only be able to resist the fear urges if I already had \"reached that something\". l am simply not there yet, even though I wish I was. I will keep trying.\n\nUnrelated, I've just glanced back & saw how many times I used the word \"I\". I play an incredibly central character in my life, & in how I process things. I don't know what to make of this. I've pretty much known this & have always wished I could get the concept & importance of myself out from my own head. Only just now, writing this, did I have some conception of \"does it matter?\""

    "text": "It feels like you're falling through the air in failure, just to hit solid ground: You feel like you roll over just to fall off the next cliff, just to hit the same flat ground again, just to fall again, & it hurts. There's never any upward progress, never a feeling of lasting accomplishment, & it feels like it just gets snowier & more alone. But think about if you managed to climb up one of those cliffs through hard work & improvement. At the top of the cliff, you would be greeted by more flat ground, same as you were on at the bottom of the cliff. You could enter a reverse cycle of climbing cliff after cliff, & at the end of each one you will still be just standing on flat ground. Maybe there's no cycle, & you go through & wild journey of ups & downs & sideways. At the end, there's just more flat ground for you to \"simply stand on\" waiting for you.\n\nWhat's the difference between climbing & falling here? Climbing feels good, & you feel like you're making progress. Falling feels bad, & it seems to be a big cold lonely reset. It sucks. You want to be climbing instead of falling. But at each moment, when climbing or falling, what are you doing? You are exactly where you are. The ground at the top of the cliff feels the same to stand on as the ground at the botton. In both cases, you are where you are, & you're doing exactly what you're doing. When climbing you're doing something. When falling, you're doing something. So what's the difference between climbing & falling?\n\nThe fact that there are infinite cliffs to climb & that the summit of each becomes identical to the last & that there are infinite cliffs to fall down & that the base of each becomes identical to the last shows that it's all relative, & the only thing that's actually ever real is where you are right now, & what you're doing. The cyclical & infinite nature of it all proves that it doesn't matter where in it. At any given point, you are where you are, & you're doing what you're doing.\n\nYou can look at the summit of a higher cliff & point & wish you were there instead. Why? You could also point to the summit of a different cliff slightly to the left, or of one still above you but slightly lower than the others. You could point to the summit of a cliff below you. Why? The top of each cliff is the exact same-feeling flat ground that you're standing on right now. If you got to any of those summits, you could point around at the summits you could see from that one. Why? Don't limit your self to summits. You could point at a spot midway up a nearby cliff & say you want to be there. Or at some place in the air below you. Why? You can be anywhere & point to anywhere else & say that you want to be there instead. Why? It each point, you are where you are, & you're doing what you're doing. If you go to some other point, you're not \"over there\" now; you're still seeing from your own eyes \"here\", & so it still is the case that you're exactly where you are and you're doing exactly what you're doing,\n\nThe beauty is that you can also ask yourself \"Why not?\" There's no reason to go somewhere, but also no reason to stay where you are. Moving an inch to the left is the same as climbing a cliff is the same as falling down 5. Because at each pont, you simply are where you are. Maybe you're standing on the hands of 10 others who got you to where you are now, or maybe you're onthe side of a diff with boots stamping on your fingers. It doesn't matter; you simply are where you are.\n\nThe real beauty is that the question of \"Why\" or \"Why not\" doesn't actually matter. Where you are is simply where you are at all times, & so is irrelevant. What really matters is whatr you're doing right now. You're at the bottom of a cliff; okay. What are you doing. You're at the top of a cliff; okay. What are you doing. It's cold & snowy & lonely; okay. What are you doing. Depending on where you are you might be elated, or may feel defeated, or may want to give up, or may feel infuriated, or may be simply confused. You can feel all of these to the fullest, but what matters is this; what are you doing? Look at yourself right now.\n\nYou just had a crazy two months. You trained hand for [event], & now it's over. In those two months, you also created a board game. That was really fun. You also wrote in your journal a lot - that helped you process things. You also made meals & spent a lot of time in the kitchen. You also went for walks. You also got stressed at homework assignments. You just had a crazy two months, & each event & feeling was real when you were in it. Two months is arbitrary; you also just went through three months. You also just went through two years, & through two weeks. You're about to go through another two months. And through three months. & through 5 days. & through 5 years. At each point you are where you are. What are you doing. Right now, you're right here. What are you doing?"

Maybe it's an anxiety thing, where I feel the need to explain & justify what I'm about to do.

It needn't even be for a long time, I've just gotten used to constant distractions & breaks & multitasking & context switching. I need to first learn just how to focus on a single thing - this comes with meditation. Not necessarily for a long time (yet), but even just 15 to 30 minutes at first. Note: dfter finishing that sentence I got distracted! Wasn't even writing for 5 minutes. Being able to stop the thoughts that come from other brain areas that try to direct my attention towards them is the key to this, which is why I said this starts with meditating again.\n\nI need to start approaching working on things like they're idle games or something- not worrying about an ending nor \"finishing another step\" but simple allowing myself to work on it for the sake of working on it, even if that means I end up needing to stop mid-step, or worse, end up making \"no progress.\" My fear of \"not making progress\" on a task keeps me from attempting it, which is a self fulfilling prophecy.

    "text": "- I think thatpeople often are naturally driven by either anger, sadness, or a combination of the two. \"anger\" and \"sadness\" being very specific representations of the actual associations I have for what I'm talking about, but they'll suffice - just don't take anger and sadness literally for this, take it metaphorically\n- People driven by anger and more active, want to *do* things, feel compelled to comment on things or change things or talk about things, basically they wanna get their hands on things.\n- People driven by sadness are more passive, observers, experience driven\n- I have only sadness inside of me - which sounds very weepy but it's not like that. I have very little to no anger inside of me - to the extent that I'm usually low energy, very passive, and I take things for what they are without ever really feeling a need or desire to \"get my hands\" on things - I want the things to speak for themselves and be themselves.\n- I've known this for a while, but these are the most accurate words I can put it into: at the very center of my being, as a thick mass surrounding the very core of what it is to be human in the first place, I have a lot of sadness underlying everything. All of my perceptions, conceptions of the world, actions, personality traits, etc. stem from this dark, gloopy, yet familiar and almost comforting sorrow at the center of my being. It permeates everything. Often when I'm by myself, I \"return\" to a slow, dark, quiet, familiar sadness that's become like a friend to me now.\n- I don't mean this as a fancy way of saying I have depression - i DID have depression, I know what it's like, and that's not what's happening now. I'm managing fine. I just mean that fundamentally, at the center of my being, at a place so so far deep down that at this point I couldn't possibly hope to change it in this lifetime, is a vast mass of sadness.\n- People who are driven by anger fascinate my and I'm drawn to them, because I like experiencing the energy, especially if it's infectious. I like doing things, but what bubbles up from my sadness is slow and calm and steady and relaxed and deep and dark, I very seldom get active energy from it. However, that's not to say I don't enjoy experiencing active energy, which is why I'm attracted to people driven by anger. I get to experience that energy, and partake in it with someone else. And, again, I don't mean \"people driven by anger\" as in people who are always actively feeling anger. You don't always feel whichever emotion you're driven by, it just exists as an undercurrent directing how you experience the world.\n- However, people driven by anger also scare me, and\n- I feel like of the two, I'm glad I'm driven by sadness. From what I've seen, being driven by anger tears at your soul, often forces you into destructive vices. High highs but low lows. And very lonely, too - lonely in a destructive sense.\n- Sadness is lonely too (everyone, at their center, is lonely) but in almost a comforting way. It's like a weighted blanket you can't take off. It often stops you from being able to move how you wish you could, and permeates life with a very mellow and sorrowful vibe in quiet moments, but it's in a familiar and almost comforting way.\n- Almost think of it like this; with sadness, you are pitted *with* the sadness, whereas with anger you are pitted *against* the anger. Even though neither is really good per se, one feels lonely in somehow a less lonely way, like life itself shrugs it's shoulders with you, whereas the other feels lonely in a catastrophic and hostile way, like you're constantly fighting through life.\n- This may seem trivial, but I've known about my sadness via what interests me - the music I like listening to is all very voidy and dreamy, and I've even told someone that a sort of feeling of \"floating submerged underwater completely limp\" is my \"favorite experience\", which is essentially why I try to emulate through a lot of music I listen to.\n- The catalyst for this realization of sad/anger was talking to [name], but what really made me associate it with myself is the realization that what I draw comes almost directly from this sadness. To the extent that, I actively find it harder to draw when I'm \"feeling good,\" (or at least come up with ideas for what to draw) since I rely heavily on my synesthesia for help with drawing, and my synesthesia seems tied to this sadness within me. To distance myself from the sadness is to distance myself from the synesthesia, which is to distance myself from my inspiration"

    "text": "- Steps to realizing something obvious\n- \"The Thing To Realize\" = LESSON\n- There will be a LESSON to learn that you likely hear a lot, so much so that it becomes cliche obvious advice. It's a LESSON where obviously it's true (i.e. \"be honest with yourself\", \"to achieve things in your life you have to put effort in\", etc.), so much so that you basically know it's a good LESSON without even thinking about it.\n- Because it's so obvious, you'll know the advice by heart and may even follow it sometimes by principle (i.e. you'll catch yourself being dishonest with yourself and be like \"yeah I know I should be honest\" and change how you act) but in the larger picture you generally won't live by it/understand it and why it's actually good advice fully\n- At some point in your life, you will experience an \"event\" that changes your perspective on something and make you feel like you had a breakthrough understanding about some part of life that was previously held secret to you. This can be an experience, or you thinking, or someone telling you about the thing, etc. You'll view this as a key point in your character development as a person, as the realization will solve a lot of problems you've been having and/or show you solutions\n- You will realize (perhaps quickly, perhaps not) that the amazing breakthrough lesson you just learned, summed up, is actually just the simply cliche LESSON that you've \"known\" your whole life, but you've only just now truly internalized it and realized what it means to you\n- Realizing that even though coming to the final realization about the LESSON is extremely fucking crucial, there's no way you can properly teach anyone else the LESSON. After all, even though it's a good LESSON and is obviously true, you had heard it your entire life and only just recently actually internalized it. Prior to actually internalizing it, if someone came up to you and said something like \"listen to me, you need to actually put in effort to achieve things. You haven't actually realized it yet but this is really important\" you'd have probably gotten annoyed or thought they were stupid for acting like a) such a basic LESSON was so goddamn important when everyone knows it and b) acting like you hadn't already understood the LESSON even though it was so basic that obviously you had already, even though unbeknownst to you, the LESSON was more important than you realized and you hadn't already properly understood it. At this point you feel kind of alone because you can't simply yell \"YEAH BUT GO THROUGH THE SAME REALIZATION I DID BECAUSE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY GET IT YET\" at someone and have them react with anything besides anger and annoyance, and so you have to simply accept that some people in your life have realized it and some haven't.\n- Realizing that even though the LESSON is what people should be trying to learn, you can't really get someone to learn it directly. i.e. even if someone believes you that it's more important than they realize and that they haven't understood it fully, you would have a very hard time directly getting them to the same realization. This is because for the realization to actually personally matter to someone, they have to go through some sort of experience to realize it by themselves. You can give them the necessary info to get there by explaining, but it's entirely up to them whether they will utilize the tools and get to the conclusion with it or not. This means that often the most effective way to learn an important LESSON is to a) be continually taught what the LESSON is and how to achieve it, b) go through an event that changes your outlook on life, c) realize that the realization was actually just you properly internalizing the LESSON that you thought you had known all along. In effect, the most effective way to learn a lesson is to get all the tools for it, and then forget about it (not completely forget, but just kind of hold it in your mind) until something happens that causes it all to actually come together for you. You can't (or it's hard to) simply \"think hard enough about the LESSON\" and properly internalize it that way\n- TLDR; You can know obviously important lessons without actually \"knowing\" them, and it will take an event or breakthrough to show you how important and meaningful the advice actually was even with how obvious it sounded and how much you thought you already knew it."

Even though you don't \"like\" being anxious, you actually have more control over the situation if you are because you know that you won't influence it - it a) tries to avoid responsibility and b) is built on a mistrust of yourself acting in a situation, for fear of what consequences might arise that you can't control\n- To \"be confident\" is to accept essentially that you DON'T have control over the situation, and instead of seeing that and saying \"well I'll do this and this and this to try and get more control\", you essentially say \"ok\" and act even while knowing that you don't know what consequences your actions will have\n- Ex. sitting down in a chair confidently entails you don't know exactly where your body will come to rest, how you'll sit down, what you might be sitting on, etc\n- As you live, you will NOT know the consequences of every action, you WILL be hurt, and you WILL hurt others. To live confidently is to accept this and use every consequence and incoming/outgoing hurt to better yourself, whereas to live anxiously is to live \"with 1 life left\" and try to prevent any actions or hurts, which can only be done by not living\n- It's like knowing there are edge cases you haven't considered yet with possible consequences, and saying \"that's ok\" instead of stressing abt covering it"

    "text": "- Human beings in general, in a healthy state of mind, would be naturally polyamorous\n- Monogamy is essentially built on our desire for attachments and stability and for things to \"not change\"\n- Love for any one person doesn't affect or dilute your love for any other person. I have loved those I have been in relationships with without either affecting my love for the other, and without either affecting my love for my siblings, and my love for my friends, etc.\n- True love comes from a love of the other person, not your attachment with the other person. Loving someone, yet being okay if you never talked to them again, if a more pure love than loving someone and wanting to \"have them\" forever.\n- The second is a possessive love that comes from the very act of having control and stability and is essentially a love for your unchanging idea of the person and the attachment, rather than a love for the changing and temporary person and attachment themselves.\n- The first, however, is a love that acknowledges that it may not last forever and that the person/object of love will change from what they are now, and so it allows you in a purer sense to love them for as they are NOW, without any thought of the future or attachments or stability. You love the person purely for them as a person, nothing more and nothing less.\n- Because of this, true and unconditional love can be felt for multiple people. Love for the sake of attachment doesn't follow this rule, as to love someone for the attachment you have is necessarily to lessen your love of other attachments. (bad phrasing)\n- So why, when we can unconditionally and truly love multiple people, do we chose a single person to put a label of \"partner\", \"spouse\", \"girl/boyfriend\", etc on?\n- Do we choose the person we \"love the most?\" What if someone else comes into our lives and we love them even more - not that we stop loving the first person, or love the second person as some sort of departure from the first, but because we simply love the second person and that's it?\n- Placing the labels seems less \"I love YOU, and I love you the MOST\" and more \"I love you and NOT ANYONE ELSE\". Seems more exclusive of others than inclusive of the two that the label is between\n- This is fundamentally built on a desire for stability - we want to be with one person, and the label attempts to signify that that won't change and that that person loves you forever and you love them forever and that's it and nothing about that will change\n- Take, for example, your partner falls in love with someone - not romantically, they are still invested in you, yet they tell you that they love the other person \"as much as\" they love you. Does this spawn feelings of discontent or resentment? Why? Those feelings don't actually come from being upset that your partner loves someone - if you're following with me up until now, you've already admitted that love for someone really doesn't affect your love for anyone else.\n- As such, these feelings essentially come from worry of your partner \"leaving you for the the other person\" - and as such you are really anchored in a love of the attachment rather than a love for the other person\n- So, having this label based only on love doesn't really seem right. The only other thing it could really be based on is romanstic or sexual attraction for another person\n- But this hold even less weight than the label being based on love. It seems fairly straight forward to see how sexual attraction for any one person isn't affected by sexual attraction for any other person, and indeed is hardly even tied to the person themselves - it's simply tied to appearance, which can change within one person and might be mimicked by another.\n- So, we are left to conclude that monogamy, and the labels we use to reinforce them, are really based on arbitrary defenses that cover up our desire for change and stability, which is a foolish desire. And monogamy based on societal reasons is so arbitrary I won't even acknowledge it.\n- So, someone who has worked on themselves enough to surpass this desire for attachments and stability - which, honestly, is nothing short of basically attaining enlightenment, since attachment is essentially the basis of what it is to be \"a human in society\" - wouldn't see any difference in devoting themselves to one person or many, and as such would be naturally polyamorous"

My face so young and vibrant and full of life, like I be ready to run through a million different facial expressions and motions and end with a grand smile meant for nobody but the entire world.

I'm sick of talking to others and feeling like it's a trial every time where I have to judge whether I passed or not at the end of it and regardless of if I did or didn't I obsess over my \"performance\" for hours until the next one, or I am just constantly annoyed by social interaction and want to get away from it even while simultaneously thinking \"you should embrace talking more and be more carefree with people\".\n- I'm sick of realizing things about myself because the realizations are always that another layer of issues has been laid over my mind, and that I'm one step more divorced from who I used to be, and that I need to change things about myself otherwise they will destroy me, and then never actually accomplishing it. I take the happiness from being alone or happening to be in a good mood as evidence that I'm improving - and in a sense I am, because those times are happening more often, but it's a) never because of anything I've done and b) is never because any of the issues went away, it's more that I was able to ignore them for a while. For if I'm reading this in the future, I'm writing this after Spring Break in college when I was 20 years old (very hopeful about myself improving from severe depression that lasted until early this semester and climaxed/ended with [name]'s breakup), so I'm truly not doing too bad. I just fear it's not for the right reasons, and that even if I am improving, there's something irreversible that I want to get back.\n- I'm so tired of it taking genuine mental and physical effort to smile, respond to people, or be an active communicator in general so to speak. It feels like every interaction is timed in my head, and that I'm either feeling trapped or insufficient in some way, feel tired and want to \"restart with more energy\", or some other shit.\n- I think I just miss my youth and the energy that I have, and resent that through a combination of the emotional abuse and my own internal issues (insecurity!) I have become someone who is constantly mentally fatigued and stops everything I do before I even start it.\n- I used to joke mentally about having \"Knees days\" (from song Knees my Injury Reserve) but I think I just have a Knees mind. Even if I'm doing better now and I'm happier, it's coming from a Knees mind. Why can't I laugh genuinely? Why do I check for reactions and mentally assess the situation after every single thing that happens? Why do I keep spacing out in the middle of things and having mini existential crises where I simply sit and stare while tapping my fingers or some shit and can't \"focus\" again for a while?\n- I want to work on things because I want to create things and I don't just want to sit around consuming all the time. However, I'm bad at actually creating things because it takes so long and I want to \"be good at it\" already, and I think that even if I was \"good at something\" I wouldn't like it\n- As per the [name] video I think that's because there's no point in me \"being good\" at something because that inevitably leads to mean either \"getting good\" and then having no purpose or reason to keep doing the thing, or the process of \"getting good\" is too slow because I'm impatient and want to see results fast. In order to get over this, I either need to find \"new things\" that i enjoy doing for the purpose of doing them rather than because I'm good at them, or I need to learn to get past the slow incremental steps of getting good so that I can create the things I want"

We aren't happy that something bad happened, we are looking for things to be happy about even in the middle of something that went wrong."

    "text": "- Adding \"but what if you personally knew the other person\" is a misleading question\n- People think that you are being hipocritical if you say \"kill one person over two\" if you don't know anybody in the scenario but say \"kill two people over one\" if the one was a close friend, or the other two were people who had wronged you/\"deserved to die\"/etc.\n- What you answer to that question is what you actually believe, but what you would answer if you had no relation to anyone in the scenario is how you believe people should behave\n- You aren't being hipocritical of your other answer; the circumstances changed and so did the answer\n- The effect of relation of the people in the scenario to the person deciding was 0, so that didn't impact their answer at all (what a person who had all the thoughts/beliefs/values as the decider but none of the relation to the other person) but the effect of the relation was >0 in the second scenario, so it did impact their answer.\n- They aren't going back on anything they said, we are just learning more about people's moral compasses as we add different pieces together from their answers and actions\n- We should all try to agree on who we should all try to be, rather than who we all should be.\n- It's an individual thing once we start adding the \"what if you knew x or y in the scenario\", and so basing someone's moral compass off of what it points to in one position is kind of bullshit.\n- Asking these broad questions and then having everyone debate them is a lot of times redundant because people try to argue over what everyone should be, and not everybody can be that ideal person all the time, so of course no true consensus will form\n- We have to answer all questions as if we didn't know anything about the other people in the scenario; otherwise we are basically just debating experiences\n- People can agree on a point but still differ to slightly different degrees\n- \"Family member\" related moral questions offer good insight into those points of a person's moral compass, but should not be confused for the entire compass"
